'''Anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[Political movement|movement]] that is sceptical of [[authority]] and rejects all involuntary, coercive forms of [[hierarchy]]. Anarchism calls for the abolition of the [[State (polity)|state]], which it holds to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful. As a historically [[left-wing]] movement, placed on the farthest left of the [[political spectrum]], it is usually described alongside [[libertarian Marxism]] as the [[libertarian]] wing ([[libertarian socialism]]) of the [[socialist movement]], and has a strong historical association with [[anti-capitalism]] and [[socialism]].

The [[history of anarchism]] goes back to [[prehistory]], when humans lived in anarchic societies long before the establishment of formal states, [[realm]]s, or [[empire]]s. With the rise of organised hierarchical bodies, [[scepticism]] toward authority also rose, but it was not until the 19th century that a self-conscious political movement emerged. During the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers' struggles for [[emancipation]]. Various [[anarchist schools of thought]] formed during this period. Anarchists have taken part in several revolutions, most notably in the [[Spanish Civil War]], whose end marked the end of the [[classical era of anarchism]]. In the last decades of the 20th and into the 21st century, the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more.

Anarchism employs a [[diversity of tactics]] in order to meet its ideal ends which can be broadly separated into revolutionary and evolutionary tactics; there is significant overlap between the two, which are merely descriptive. Revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state, having taken a violent turn in the past, while evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like. Anarchist thought, criticism, and [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] have played a part in diverse areas of human society. Anarchism has been both defended and criticised; criticism of anarchism include claims that it is internally inconsistent, violent, or utopian.

[[File:WilhelmWeitling.jpg|thumb|[[Wilhelm Weitling]] is an example of a writer who added to anarchist theory without using the exact term.{{sfn|Carlson|1972|pp=22–23}}]]
The etymological origin of ''anarchism'' is from the Ancient Greek ''anarkhia'', meaning &quot;without a ruler&quot;, composed of the prefix ''an-'' (&quot;without&quot;) and the word ''arkhos'' (&quot;leader&quot; or &quot;ruler&quot;). The suffix ''[[-ism]]'' denotes the ideological current that favours [[anarchy]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bates|1y=2017|1p=128|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2p=217}} ''Anarchism'' appears in English from 1642 as ''anarchisme'' and ''anarchy'' from 1539; early English usages emphasised a sense of disorder.{{sfnm|1a1=Merriam-Webster|1y=2019|1loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;|2a1=''Oxford English Dictionary''|2y=2005|2loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;|3a1=Sylvan|3y=2007|3p=260}} Various factions within the [[French Revolution]] labelled their opponents as ''anarchists'', although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists. Many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as [[William Godwin]] (1756–1836) and [[Wilhelm Weitling]] (1808–1871) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation but did not use ''anarchist'' or ''anarchism'' in describing themselves or their beliefs.{{sfn|Joll|1964|pp=27–37}}

The first political philosopher to call himself an ''anarchist'' ({{lang-fr|anarchiste}}) was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865), marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France,{{sfn|Nettlau|1996|p=162}} ''[[libertarianism]]'' has often been used as a synonym for anarchism{{sfn|Guérin|1970|loc=&quot;The Basic Ideas of Anarchism&quot;}} and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Ward|1y=2004|1p=62|2a1=Goodway|2y=2006|2p=4|3a1=Skirda|3y=2002|3p=183|4a1=Fernández|4y=2009|4p=9}} Some usages of ''libertarianism'' refers to [[individualistic]] [[free-market]] philosophy only, and [[free-market anarchism]] in particular is termed ''libertarian anarchism''.{{sfn|Morris|2002|p=61}}

While the term ''libertarian'' has been largely synonymous with anarchism,{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1992|1p=641|2a1=Cohn|2y=2009|2p=6}} its meaning has more recently diluted with wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups,{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} including both the [[New Left]] and [[libertarian Marxists]], who do not associate themselves with [[authoritarian socialists]] or a [[vanguard party]], and extreme [[cultural liberals]], who are primarily concerned with [[civil liberties]].{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} Additionally, some anarchists use ''[[libertarian socialist]]''{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1992|1p=641|2a1=Chomsky|2y=2005|2p=123|3a1=Cohn|3y=2009|3p=6|4a1=Adams|4a2=Levy|4y=2018|4p=104}} to avoid anarchism's negative connotations and emphasise its connections with [[socialism]].{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} ''Anarchism'' is broadly used to describe the [[anti-authoritarian]] wing of the [[socialist movement]].{{sfn|Adams|Levy|2018|p=104}}{{refn|In ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'' (1970),{{sfn|Guérin|1970|p=12}} anarchist historian [[Daniel Guérin]] described it as a synonym for [[libertarian socialism]], and wrote that anarchism &quot;is really a synonym for socialism. The anarchist is primarily a socialist whose aim is to abolish the exploitation of man by man. Anarchism is only one of the streams of socialist thought, that stream whose main components are concern for liberty and haste to abolish the State.&quot;{{sfn|Arvidsson|2017}} In his many works on anarchism, such as ''Chomsky on Anarchism'' (2005),{{sfn|Chomsky|2005|p=123}} historian [[Noam Chomsky]] describes anarchism, alongside [[libertarian Marxism]], as the [[libertarian]] wing of [[socialism]].{{sfn|Otero|1994|p=617}}|group=nb}} Anarchism is contrasted to socialist forms which are state-oriented or from above.{{sfn|Osgood|1889|p=1}} Scholars of anarchism generally highlight anarchism's socialist credentials{{sfn|Newman|2005|p=15}} and criticise attempts at creating dichotomies between the two.{{sfn|Morriss|2015|p=64}} Some scholars describe anarchism as having many influences from [[liberalism]],{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} and being both liberals and socialists but more so,{{sfn|Walter|2002|p=44}} while most scholars reject [[anarcho-capitalism]] as a misunderstanding of anarchist principles.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1992|1pp=564–565|2a1=Jennings|2y=1993|2p=143|3a1=Gay|3a2=Gay|3y=1999|3p=15|4a1=Morriss|4y=2008|4p=13|5a1=Johnson|5y=2008|5p=169|6a1=Franks|6y=2013|6pp=393–394}}{{refn|[[Herbert L. Osgood]] claimed that anarchism is &quot;the extreme antithesis&quot; of [[authoritarian communism]] and [[state socialism]].{{sfn|Osgood|1889|p=1}} [[Peter Marshall (author)|Peter Marshall]] states that &quot;[i]n general anarchism is closer to socialism than liberalism. ... Anarchism finds itself largely in the socialist camp, but it also has outriders in liberalism. It cannot be reduced to socialism, and is best seen as a separate and distinctive doctrine.&quot;{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} According to [[Jeremy Jennings]], &quot;[i]t is hard not to conclude that these ideas&quot;, referring to [[anarcho-capitalism]], &quot;are described as anarchist only on the basis of a misunderstanding of what anarchism is.&quot; Jennings adds that &quot;anarchism does not stand for the untrammelled freedom of the individual (as the 'anarcho-capitalists' appear to believe) but, as we have already seen, for the extension of individuality and community.&quot;{{sfn|Jennings|1999|p=147}} [[Nicolas Walter]] wrote that &quot;anarchism does derive from liberalism and socialism both historically and ideologically. ... In a sense, anarchists always remain liberals and socialists, and whenever they reject what is good in either they betray anarchism itself. ... We are liberals but more so, and socialists but more so.&quot;{{sfn|Walter|2002|p=44}} Michael Newman includes anarchism as one of many [[socialist traditions]], especially the more socialist-aligned tradition following Proudhon and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].{{sfn|Newman|2005|p=15}} [[Brian Morris (anthropologist)|Brian Morriss]] argues that it is &quot;conceptually and historically misleading&quot; to &quot;create a dichotomy between socialism and anarchism.&quot;{{sfn|Morriss|2015|p=64}}|group=nb}}

While [[opposition to the state]] is central to anarchist thought, defining ''anarchism'' is not an easy task for scholars, as there is a lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter, and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently.{{sfn|Long|2013|p=217}}{{refn|One common definition adopted by anarchists is that anarchism is a cluster of political philosophies opposing [[authority]] and [[hierarchical organisation]], including [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]], [[Anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]], the [[State (polity)|state]], and all associated [[institution]]s, in the conduct of all [[human relations]] in favour of a society based on [[decentralisation]], [[freedom]], and [[voluntary association]]. Scholars highlight that this definition has the same shortcomings as the definition based on anti-authoritarianism (''[[a posteriori]]'' conclusion), anti-statism (anarchism is much more than that),{{sfnm|1a1=McLaughlin|1y=2007|1p=166|2a1=Jun|2y=2009|2p=507|3a1=Franks|3y=2013|3pp=386–388}} and etymology (negation of rulers).{{sfnm|1a1=McLaughlin|1y=2007|1pp=25–29|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2pp=217}}|group=nb}} Major definitional elements include the will for a non-coercive society, the rejection of the state apparatus, the belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non-coercive society, and a suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|pp=25–26}}

== History ==
{{main|History of anarchism}}

=== Pre-modern era ===
[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Napoli, 1969) - BEIC 6353768.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|[[Zeno of Citium]] (c. 334 – c. 262 BC), whose ''[[Republic (Zeno)|Republic]]'' inspired [[Peter Kropotkin]]{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=70}}]]
During the prehistoric era of mankind, an established authority did not exist. It was after the creation of towns and cities that institutions of authority were established and anarchistic ideas espoused as a reaction.{{sfn|Graham|2005|pp=xi–xiv}} The most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in China and Greece. In China, [[philosophical anarchism]] (the discussion on the legitimacy of the state) was delineated by [[Taoist]] philosophers [[Zhuang Zhou]] and [[Laozi]].{{sfnm|1a1=Coutinho|1y=2016|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=54}} Alongside [[Stoicism]], Taoism has been said to have had &quot;significant anticipations&quot; of anarchism.{{Sfn|Sylvan|2007|p=257}}

Anarchic attitudes were also articulated by tragedians and philosophers in Greece. [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] used the myth of [[Antigone]] to illustrate the conflict between rules set by the state and personal [[autonomy]]. [[Socrates]] questioned Athenian authorities constantly and insisted on the right of individual freedom of conscience. [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] dismissed human law (''[[Nomos (sociology)|nomos]]'') and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature (''[[physis]]''). [[Stoics]] were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4, 66–73}}

During the [[Middle Ages]], there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements in the [[Muslim world]] or in Christian Europe. This kind of tradition later gave birth to [[religious anarchism]]. In the [[Sasanian Empire]], [[Mazdak]] called for an [[egalitarian]] society and the [[abolition of monarchy]], only to be soon executed by Emperor [[Kavad I]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=86}}

In [[Basra]], religious sects preached against the state. In Europe, various sects developed anti-state and libertarian tendencies. Libertarian ideas further emerged during the [[Renaissance]] with the spread of [[humanism]], [[rationalism]], and [[reason]]ing through Europe. Novelists fictionalised ideal societies that were based on voluntarism rather than coercion. The [[Age of Enlightenment]] further pushed towards anarchism with the optimism for social progress.{{sfn|Adams|2014|pp=33–63}}{{Page range too broad|date=October 2021}}

=== Modern era ===
During the [[French Revolution]], partisan groups such as the [[Enragés]] and the {{lang|fr|[[sans-culottes]]}} saw a turning point in the fermentation of anti-state and federalist sentiments.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=4}} The first anarchist currents developed throughout the 18th century as [[William Godwin]] espoused [[philosophical anarchism]] in England, morally delegitimising the state, [[Max Stirner]]'s thinking paved the way to [[Individualist anarchism|individualism]] and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]'s theory of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] found fertile soil in France.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4–5}} By the late 1870s, various anarchist schools of thought had become well-defined and a wave of then unprecedented [[globalisation]] occurred from 1880 to 1914.{{sfn|Levy|2011|pp=10–15}} This era of [[classical anarchism]] lasted until the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and is considered the golden age of anarchism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4–5}}

[[File:Bakunin.png|thumb|upright|Mikhail Bakunin opposed the Marxist aim of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] and allied himself with the federalists in the First International before his expulsion by the Marxists.]]
Drawing from mutualism, [[Mikhail Bakunin]] founded [[collectivist anarchism]] and entered the [[International Workingmen's Association]], a class worker union later known as the First International that formed in 1864 to unite diverse revolutionary currents. The International became a significant political force, with [[Karl Marx]] being a leading figure and a member of its General Council. Bakunin's faction (the [[Jura Federation]]) and Proudhon's followers (the mutualists) opposed [[state socialism]], advocating political [[abstentionism]] and small property holdings.{{sfnm|1a1=Dodson|1y=2002|1p=312|2a1=Thomas|2y=1985|2p=187|3a1=Chaliand|3a2=Blin|3y=2007|3p=116}} After bitter disputes, the Bakuninists were expelled from the International by the [[Marxists]] at the [[1872 Hague Congress]].{{sfnm|1a1=Graham|1y=2019|1pp=334–336|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=24}} Anarchists were treated similarly in the [[Second International]], being ultimately expelled in 1896.{{sfn|Levy|2011|p=12}} Bakunin famously predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by Marx's terms, they would end up the new tyrants of workers. In response to their expulsion from the First International, anarchists formed the [[St. Imier International]]. Under the influence of [[Peter Kropotkin]], a Russian philosopher and scientist, [[anarcho-communism]] overlapped with collectivism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=5}} Anarcho-communists, who drew inspiration from the 1871 [[Paris Commune]], advocated for free federation and for the distribution of goods according to one's needs.{{sfn|Graham|2005|p=xii}}

At the turn of the century, anarchism had spread all over the world.{{sfn|Moya|2015|p=327}} It was a notable feature of the international syndicalism movement.{{sfn|Levy|2011|p=16}} In China, small groups of students imported the humanistic pro-science version of anarcho-communism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=519–521}} Tokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from countries of the far east, travelling to the Japanese capital to study.{{sfnm|1a1=Dirlik|1y=1991|1p=133|2a1=Ramnath|2y=2019|2pp=681–682}} In Latin America, [[Anarchism in Argentina|Argentina]] was a stronghold for [[anarcho-syndicalism]], where it became the most prominent left-wing ideology.{{sfnm|1a1=Levy|1y=2011|1p=23|2a1=Laursen|2y=2019|2p=157|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3pp=504–508}} During this time, a minority of anarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary [[political violence]]. This strategy became known as [[propaganda of the deed]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=633–636}} The dismemberment of the French socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many [[Communards]] to penal colonies following the suppression of the Paris Commune favoured individualist political expression and acts.{{sfn|Anderson|2004}} Even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts, infamy came upon the movement and attempts were made to exclude them from American immigration, including the [[Immigration Act of 1903]], also called the Anarchist Exclusion Act.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1pp=633–636|2a1=Lutz|2a2=Ulmschneider|2y=2019|2p=46}} [[Illegalism]] was another strategy which some anarchists adopted during this period.{{sfn|Bantman|2019|p=374}}

[[File:Makhno group.jpg|thumb|left|Nestor Makhno seen with members of the anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]]]
Despite concerns, anarchists enthusiastically participated in the [[Russian Revolution]] in opposition to the [[White movement]]; however, they met harsh suppression after the [[Bolshevik government]] was stabilised. Several anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to Ukraine,{{sfn|Avrich|2006|p=204}} notably leading to the [[Kronstadt rebellion]] and [[Nestor Makhno]]'s struggle in the [[Free Territory]]. With the anarchists being crushed in Russia, two new antithetical currents emerged, namely [[platformism]] and [[synthesis anarchism]]. The former sought to create a coherent group that would push for revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party. Seeing the victories of the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[October Revolution]] and the resulting [[Russian Civil War]], many workers and activists turned to [[communist parties]] which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, members of major syndicalist movements such as the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|General Confederation of Labour]] and the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] left their organisations and joined the [[Communist International]].{{sfn|Nomad|1966|p=88}}

In the Spanish Civil War of 1936, anarchists and syndicalists ([[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|FAI]]) once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists. A long tradition of [[Spanish anarchism]] led to anarchists playing a pivotal role in the war. In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain, where they [[collectivised]] the land.{{sfn|Bolloten|1984|p=1107}} The [[Soviet Union]] provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war, but the result was a bitter fight among communists and anarchists at a series of events named [[May Days]] as [[Joseph Stalin]] tried to seise control of the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republicans]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=xi, 466}}

=== Post-war era ===
[[File:Rojava Sewing Cooperative.jpg|thumb|Rojava's support efforts for workers to form cooperatives is exemplified in this sewing cooperative.]]
At the end of [[World War II]], the anarchist movement was severely weakened.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=xi}} The 1960s witnessed a revival of anarchism, likely caused by a perceived failure of [[Marxism–Leninism]] and tensions built by the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=539}} During this time, anarchism found a presence in other movements critical towards both capitalism and the state such as the [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]], [[Environmental movement|environmental]], and [[peace movement]]s, the [[counterculture of the 1960s]], and the [[New Left]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=xi, 539}} It also saw a transition from its previous revolutionary nature to provocative [[anti-capitalist reform]]ism.{{sfn|Levy|2011|pp=5|p=}} Anarchism became associated with [[punk subculture]] as exemplified by bands such as [[Crass]] and the [[Sex Pistols]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=493–494}} The established [[feminist]] tendencies of [[anarcha-feminism]] returned with vigour during the [[second wave of feminism]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=556–557}} [[Black anarchism]] began to take form at this time and influenced anarchism's move from a [[Eurocentric]] demographic.{{sfn|Williams|2015|p=680}} This coincided with its failure to gain traction in Northern Europe and its unprecedented height in Latin America.{{sfn|Harmon|2011|p=70}}

Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence within [[anti-capitalist]], [[anti-war]] and [[anti-globalisation]] movements.{{sfn|Rupert|2006|p=66}} Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), the [[Group of Eight]] and the [[World Economic Forum]]. During the protests, ''ad hoc'' leaderless anonymous cadres known as [[black bloc]]s engaged in [[riot]]ing, [[property destruction]] and violent confrontations with the [[police]]. Other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include [[affinity group]]s, [[security culture]] and the use of decentralised technologies such as the Internet. A significant event of this period was the confrontations at the [[1999 Seattle WTO conference]].{{sfn|Rupert|2006|p=66}} Anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]] in Mexico and the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria, more commonly known as [[Rojava]], a ''de facto'' [[Permanent autonomous zone|autonomous region]] in northern Syria.{{sfn|Ramnath|2019|p=691}}

== Thought ==
{{main|Anarchist schools of thought}}
Anarchist schools of thought have been generally grouped into two main historical traditions, [[social anarchism]] and [[individualist anarchism]], owing to their different origins, values and evolution.{{sfnm|1a1=McLean|1a2=McMillan|1y=2003|1loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;|2a1=Ostergaard|2y=2003|2p=14|2loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;}} The individualist current emphasises [[negative liberty]] in opposing restraints upon the free individual, while the social current emphasises [[positive liberty]] in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through equality and [[social ownership]].{{sfn|Harrison|Boyd|2003|p=251}} In a chronological sense, anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late 19th century and the post-classical currents ([[anarcha-feminism]], [[green anarchism]], and [[post-anarchism]]) developed thereafter.{{sfn|Adams|Levy|2019|p=9}}

Beyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute political anarchism lies [[philosophical anarchism]] which holds that the state lacks moral legitimacy, without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it.{{sfn|Egoumenides|2014|p=2}} A component especially of individualist anarchism,{{sfnm|1a1=Ostergaard|1y=2003|1p=12|2a1=Gabardi|2y=1986|2pp=300–302}} philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of a [[minimal state]] but claims that citizens have no [[moral obligation]] to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy.{{sfn|Klosko|2005|p=4}} Anarchism pays significant attention to moral arguments since [[ethics]] have a central role in anarchist philosophy.{{sfn|Franks|2019|p=549}} Anarchism's emphasis on [[anti-capitalism]], [[egalitarianism]], and for the extension of community and individuality sets it apart from [[anarcho-capitalism]] and other types of [[economic libertarian]]ism.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1992|1pp=564–565|2a1=Jennings|2y=1993|2p=143|3a1=Gay|3a2=Gay|3y=1999|3p=15|4a1=Morriss|4y=2008|4p=13|5a1=Johnson|5y=2008|5p=169|6a1=Franks|6y=2013|6pp=393–394}}

Anarchism is usually placed on the [[far-left]] of the [[political spectrum]].{{sfnm|1a1=Brooks|1y=1994|1p=xi|2a1=Kahn|2y=2000|3a1=Moynihan|3y=2007}} Much of its [[Anarchist economics|economics]] and [[Anarchist law|legal philosophy]] reflect [[anti-authoritarian]], [[anti-statist]], [[libertarian]], and [[Radical politics|radical]] interpretations of [[left-wing]] and [[socialist]] politics{{sfn|Guérin|1970|p=12}} such as [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivism]], [[Anarcho-communism|communism]], [[Individualist anarchism|individualism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], and [[Anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalism]], among other [[libertarian socialist]] economic theories.{{sfn|Guérin|1970|p=35|loc=&quot;Critique of authoritarian socialism&quot;}} As anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview,{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=14–17}} many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely.{{sfn|Sylvan|2007|p=262}} One reaction against [[sectarianism]] within the anarchist milieu was [[anarchism without adjectives]], a call for toleration and unity among anarchists first adopted by [[Fernando Tarrida del Mármol]] in 1889 in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time.{{sfn|Avrich|1996|p=6}} Belief in political [[nihilism]] has been espoused by anarchists.{{sfn|Walter|2002|p=52}} Despite separation, the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities but rather as tendencies that intermingle and are connected through a set of uniform principles such as individual and local autonomy, mutual aid, network organisation, communal democracy, justified authority and decentralisation.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1p=1–6|2a1=Angelbeck|2a2=Grier|2y=2012|2p=551}}

=== Classical ===
[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|upright|Pierre-Joseph Proudhon is the primary proponent of mutualism and influenced many future individualist anarchist and social anarchist thinkers.{{sfn|Wilbur|2019|p=216–218}}]]
Inceptive currents among classical anarchist currents were [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and [[Individualist anarchism|individualism]]. They were followed by the major currents of [[social anarchism]] ([[Collectivist anarchism|collectivist]], [[Anarcho-communism|communist]] and [[Anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalist]]). They differ on organisational and economic aspects of their ideal society.{{sfn|Adams|Levy|2019|p=2}}

Mutualism is an 18th-century economic theory that was developed into anarchist theory by [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]. Its aims include [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], [[Free association (Marxism and anarchism)|free association]], voluntary [[contract]], [[federation]] and [[monetary reform]] of both credit and currency that would be regulated by a bank of the people.{{sfn|Wilbur|2019|pp=213–218}} Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.{{sfnm|1a1=Avrich|1y=1996|1p=6|2a1=Miller|2y=1991|2p=11}} In ''[[What Is Property?]]'' (1840), Proudhon first characterised his goal as a &quot;third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property.&quot;{{sfn|Pierson|2013|p=187}} Collectivist anarchism is a [[revolutionary socialist]] form of anarchism{{sfn|Morris|1993|p=76}} commonly associated with [[Mikhail Bakunin]].{{sfn|Shannon|2019|p=101}} Collectivist anarchists advocate [[collective ownership]] of the [[means of production]] which is theorised to be achieved through violent revolution{{sfn|Avrich|1996|pp=3–4}} and that workers be paid according to time worked, rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism. Collectivist anarchism arose alongside [[Marxism]] but rejected the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist [[stateless society]].{{sfnm|1a1=Heywood|1y=2017|1pp=146–147|2a1=Bakunin|2y=1990}}

[[Anarcho-communism]] is a theory of anarchism that advocates a [[communist society]] with [[common ownership]] of the means of production,{{sfn|Mayne|1999|p=131}} [[direct democracy]] and a [[Horizontalidad|horizontal]] network of [[voluntary association]]s, [[workers' council]]s and [[worker cooperative]]s, with production and consumption based on the guiding principle &quot;[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his need]].&quot;{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1p=327|2a1=Turcato|2y=2019|2pp=237–323}} Anarcho-communism developed from radical socialist currents after the [[French Revolution]]{{sfn|Graham|2005}} but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the [[First International]].{{sfn|Pernicone|2009|pp=111–113}} It was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of [[Peter Kropotkin]],{{sfn|Turcato|2019|pp=239–244}} whose specific style would go onto become the dominating view of anarchists by the late 19th century.{{sfn|Levy|2011|pp=6|p=}} Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that views [[labour syndicate]]s as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are [[direct action]], workers' [[solidarity]] and [[workers' self-management]].{{sfn|Van der Walt|2019|p=249}}

Individualist anarchism is a set of several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the [[individual]] and their [[Will (philosophy)|will]] over any kinds of external determinants.{{sfn|Ryley|2019|p=225}} Early influences on individualist forms of anarchism include [[William Godwin]], [[Max Stirner]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]]. Through many countries, individualist anarchism attracted a small yet diverse following of Bohemian artists and intellectuals{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=440}} as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as [[illegalism]] and [[individual reclamation]].{{sfnm|1a1=Imrie|1y=1994|2a1=Parry|2y=1987|2p=15}}

=== Post-classical and contemporary ===
{{main|Contemporary anarchism}}
[[File:Jarach and Zerzan.JPG|thumb|Lawrence Jarach (left) and [[John Zerzan]] (right) are two prominent contemporary anarchist authors, with Zerzan being a prominent voice within [[anarcho-primitivism]] and Jarach a notable advocate of [[post-left anarchy]].]]
Anarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left. Interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the [[anti-globalisation movement]],{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=1}} whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=2}} As the movement shaped 21st century radicalism, wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=2}} Anarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements, at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources and [[syncretic]], combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches.{{sfn|Perlin|1979}}{{Page needed|date=October 2021}}The [[anti-capitalist]] tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary currents.{{sfn|Williams|2018|p=4}}

Contemporary news coverage which emphasizes [[black bloc]] demonstrations has reinforced anarchism's historical association with chaos and violence. Its publicity has also led more scholars in fields such as [[anthropology]] and [[history]] to engage with the anarchist movement, although contemporary anarchism favours actions over academic theory.{{sfnm|1a1=Williams|1y=2010|1p=110|2a1=Evren|2y=2011|2p=1|3a1=Angelbeck|3a2=Grier|3y=2012|3p=549}} Various anarchist groups, tendencies, and schools of thought exist today, making it difficult to describe the contemporary anarchist movement.{{sfn|Franks|2013|pp=385–386}} While theorists and activists have established &quot;relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles&quot;, there is no consensus on which principles are core and commentators describe multiple ''anarchisms'', rather than a singular ''anarchism'', in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently. Gender equality can be a common principle, although it ranks as a higher priority to [[anarcha-feminists]] than [[anarcho-communists]].{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=386}}

Anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms, namely &quot;all centralized and hierarchical forms of government (e.g., monarchy, representative democracy, state socialism, etc.), economic class systems (e.g., capitalism, Bolshevism, feudalism, slavery, etc.), autocratic religions (e.g., fundamentalist Islam, Roman Catholicism, etc.), patriarchy, heterosexism, white supremacy, and imperialism.&quot;{{sfn|Jun|2009|pp=507–508}} Anarchist schools disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed.{{sfn|Jun|2009|p=507}} The principle of [[equal liberty]] is closer to anarchist political ethics in that it transcends both the liberal and socialist traditions. This entails that liberty and equality cannot be implemented within the state, resulting in the questioning of all forms of domination and hierarchy.{{sfn|Egoumenides|2014|p=91}}

== Tactics ==
Anarchists' tactics take various forms but in general serve two major goals, namely to first oppose [[the Establishment]] and secondly to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society, illustrating the unity of means and ends.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=107–108}} A broad categorisation can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by revolutionary means on one hand and aims to change society through evolutionary means on the other.{{sfn|Williams|2018|pp=4–5}} Evolutionary tactics embrace [[nonviolence]], reject violence and take a gradual approach to anarchist aims, although there is significant overlap between the two.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|p=125}}

Anarchist tactics have shifted during the course of the last century. Anarchists during the early 20th century focused more on strikes and militancy while contemporary anarchists use a broader array of approaches.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=112}}

=== Classical era tactics ===
[[File:McKinleyAssassination.jpg|thumb|left|The relationship between [[anarchism and violence]] is a controversial subject among anarchists as shown by anarchist [[Leon Czolgosz]] [[Assassination of William McKinley|assassinating]] [[William McKinley]].]]
During the classical era, anarchists had a militant tendency. Not only did they confront state armed forces, as in Spain and Ukraine, but some of them also employed [[terrorism]] as [[propaganda of the deed]]. Assassination attempts were carried out against heads of state, some of which were successful. Anarchists also took part in [[revolution]]s.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=112–113}} Many anarchists, especially the [[Galleanists]], believed that these attempts would be the impetus for a revolution against capitalism and the state.{{sfn|Norris|2020|pp=7-8}} Many of these attacks were done by individual assailants and the majority took place in the late 1870s, the early 1880s and the 1890s, with some still occurring in the early 1900s.{{sfnm|1a1=Levy|1y=2011|1p=13|2a1=Nesser|2y=2012|2p=62}} Their decrease in prevalence was the result of further [[judicial]] power and targeting and cataloging by state institutions.{{sfn|Harmon|2011|p=55}}

Anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been perplexing and controversial.{{sfn|Carter|1978|p=320}} On one hand, [[anarcho-pacifists]] point out the unity of means and ends.{{sfn|Fiala|2017}}{{Page needed|date=October 2021}} On the other hand, other anarchist groups advocate direct action, a tactic which can include acts of [[sabotage]] or even acts of terrorism. This attitude was quite prominent a century ago when seeing the state as a [[tyrant]] and some anarchists believing that they had every right to oppose its [[oppression]] by any means possible.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=116–117}} [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], who were proponents of limited use of violence, stated that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a [[necessary evil]].{{sfn|Carter|1978|pp=320–325}}

Anarchists took an active role in [[strike action]]s, although they tended to be antipathetic to formal [[syndicalism]], seeing it as [[reformist]]. They saw it as a part of the movement which sought to overthrow the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[capitalism]].{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=113}} Anarchists also reinforced their propaganda within the arts, some of whom practiced [[naturism]] and [[nudism]]. Those anarchists also built communities which were based on [[friendship]] and were involved in the [[news media]].{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=114}}

=== Revolutionary tactics ===
[[File:Black bloc at RNC running.jpg|thumb|Black bloc protesters parading anarcho-communism imagery such as the motto &quot;[[No War but the Class War]]&quot;]]
In the current era, Italian anarchist [[Alfredo Bonanno]], a proponent of [[insurrectionary anarchism]], has reinstated the debate on violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late 19th century by Kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards. Both Bonanno and the French group [[The Invisible Committee]] advocate for small, informal affiliation groups, where each member is responsible for their own actions but works together to bring down oppression utilizing sabotage and other violent means against state, capitalism, and other enemies. Members of The Invisible Committee were arrested in 2008 on various charges, terrorism included.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=134–135}}

Overall, contemporary anarchists are much less violent and militant than their ideological ancestors. They mostly engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots, especially in countries such as [[Anarchism in Canada|Canada]], [[Anarchism in Greece|Greece]], and [[Anarchism in Mexico|Mexico]]. Militant [[black bloc]] protest groups are known for clashing with the police;{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=115}} however, anarchists not only clash with state operators, they also engage in the struggle against fascists and racists, taking [[anti-fascist]] action and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=117}}

=== Evolutionary tactics ===
Anarchists commonly employ [[direct action]]. This can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust [[hierarchy]], or the form of self-managing their lives through the creation of counter-institutions such as communes and non-hierarchical collectives.{{sfn|Williams|2018|pp=4–5}} Decision-making is often handled in an anti-authoritarian way, with everyone having equal say in each decision, an approach known as [[horizontalism]].{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=109–117}} Contemporary-era anarchists have been engaging with various [[grassroots]] movements that are more or less based on horizontalism, although not explicitly anarchist, respecting personal autonomy and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations. In contrast with the ''big-A anarchism'' of the classical era, the newly coined term ''small-a anarchism'' signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classical-era anarchism or to refer to [[classical anarchists]] such as [[Peter Kropotkin]] and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] to justify their opinions. Those anarchists would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience which they will later theorize.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=145–149}}

The decision-making process of small anarchist [[affinity group]]s plays a significant tactical role.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=109, 119}} Anarchists have employed various methods in order to build a rough consensus among members of their group without the need of a leader or a leading group. One way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to help achieve a consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting a specific point. Minorities usually accept rough consensus, except when they feel the proposal contradicts anarchist ethics, goals and values. Anarchists usually form small groups (5–20 individuals) to enhance autonomy and friendships among their members. These kinds of groups more often than not interconnect with each other, forming larger networks. Anarchists still support and participate in strikes, especially [[Wildcat strike action|wildcat strikes]] as these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by a syndicate.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=119–121}}

As in the past, newspapers and journals are used, and anarchists have gone [[online]] in the [[World Wide Web]] to spread their message. Anarchists have found it easier to create websites because of distributional and other difficulties, hosting electronic libraries and other portals.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=118–119}} Anarchists were also involved in developing various software that are available for free. The way these hacktivists work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals, especially when it comes to preserving users' privacy from state surveillance.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=120–121}}

Anarchists organize themselves to [[Squatting|squat]] and reclaim public spaces. During important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied, they are often called [[Temporary Autonomous Zone]]s (TAZ), spaces where art, poetry, and [[surrealism]] are blended to display the anarchist ideal.{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2019|1p=139|2a1=Mattern|2y=2019|2p=596|3a1=Williams|3y=2018|3pp=5–6}} As seen by anarchists, squatting is a way to regain urban space from the capitalist market, serving pragmatical needs and also being an exemplary direct action.{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2012|1p=250|2a1=Williams|2y=2019|2p=119}} Acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=122}} Adding up these tactics while having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them, along with various forms of protesting at highly symbolic events, make up a [[carnivalesque]] atmosphere that is part of contemporary anarchist vividity.{{sfn|Morland|2004|p=37–38}}

== Key issues ==

&lt;!-- In the interest of restricting article length, please limit this section to two or three short paragraphs and add any substantial information to the main Issues in anarchism article. Thank you. --&gt;
As anarchism is a [[philosophy]] that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies, and schools of thought; disagreement over questions of values, ideology, and tactics is common. Its diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has created a number of [[definitional concerns in anarchist theory]]. The compatibility of [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]],{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1p=565|2a1=Honderich|2y=1995|2p=31|3a1=Meltzer|3y=2000|3p=50|4a1=Goodway|4y=2006|4p=4|5a1=Newman|5y=2010|5p=53}} [[Anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]], and [[Anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed, and anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and communism|communism]], [[collectivism]], [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], and [[trade unionism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[God|divine authority]], [[enlightened self-interest]], [[Veganarchism|veganism]], or any number of alternative ethical doctrines. Phenomena such as [[civilisation]], [[technology]] (e.g. within [[anarcho-primitivism]]), and the [[Anarchism and statist democracy|democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.{{sfn|De George|2005|pp=31–32}}

=== Gender, sexuality, and free love ===
{{see also|Anarchism and issues related to love and sex}}
[[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Émile Armand]] was a French individualist anarchist who propounded the virtues of free love in the Parisian anarchist milieu of the early 20th century]]
As gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy, anarchism is obliged to address, analyse, and oppose the suppression of one's autonomy because of the dynamics that gender roles traditionally impose.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|p=603}}

[[File:AnarchaFeminism.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Collection of [[anarcha-feminist]] protests, symbols, and flags]]
Sexuality was not often discussed by classical anarchists but the few that did felt that an anarchist society would lead to sexuality naturally developing.{{sfn|Lucy|2020|p=162}} Sexual violence was a concern for anarchists such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], who opposed age of consent laws, believing they would benefit predatory men.{{sfn|Lucy|2020|p=178}} A historical current that arose and flourished during 1890 and 1920 within anarchism was [[free love]]. In contemporary anarchism, this current survives as a tendency to support [[polyamory]] and [[queer anarchism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Nicholas|1y=2019|1p=611|2a1=Jeppesen|2a2=Nazar|2y=2012|2pp=175–176}} Free love advocates were against marriage, which they saw as a way of men imposing authority over women, largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men. The notion of free love was much broader and included a critique of the established order that limited women's sexual freedom and pleasure.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|pp=175–176}} Those free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses, where large groups of travelers, anarchists and other activists slept in beds together.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|p=177}} Free love had roots both in Europe and the United States; however, some anarchists struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|pp=175–177}} Anarchist feminists were advocates of free love, against marriage, and pro-choice (utilising a contemporary term), and had a similar agenda. Anarchist and non-anarchist feminists differed on [[suffrage]] but were supportive of one another.{{sfn|Kinna2019|pp=166–167}}

During the second half of the 20th century, anarchism intermingled with the [[second wave of feminism]], radicalising some currents of the feminist movement and being influenced as well. By the latest decades of the 20th century, anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women, gays, queers and other marginalised groups, with some feminist thinkers suggesting a fusion of the two currents.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=609–611}} With the [[third wave of feminism]], sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became a subject of study for anarchists, yielding a [[post-structuralist]] critique of sexual normality.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=610–611}} Some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking, suggesting that it leaned towards an individualism that was dropping the cause of social liberation.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=616–617}}

The interest of anarchists in education stretches back to the first emergence of classical anarchism. Anarchists consider proper education, one which sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and the society, to be an act of [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2019|1pp=83–85|2a2=Suissa|2y=2019|2pp=514–515, 520}} Anarchist writers such as [[William Godwin]] (''[[Political Justice]]'') and [[Max Stirner]] (&quot;[[The False Principle of Our Education]]&quot;) attacked both state education and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges.{{sfnm|1a1=Suissa|1y=2019|1pp=514, 521|2a1=Kinna|2y=2019|2pp=83–86|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3p=222}}

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and free thinker [[Francisco Ferrer]] established the [[Escuela Moderna]] in Barcelona as an opposition to the established education system which was dictated largely by the Catholic Church.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=511–512}} Ferrer's approach was secular, rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational process whilst giving pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance. Ferrer aimed to educate the working class and explicitly sought to foster [[class consciousness]] among students. The school closed after constant harassment by the state and Ferrer was later arrested. Nonetheless, his ideas formed the inspiration for a series of [[Modern School (United States)|modern schools]] around the world.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=511–514}} Christian anarchist [[Leo Tolstoy]], who published the essay ''Education and Culture'', also established a similar school with its founding principle being that &quot;for education to be effective it had to be free.&quot;{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=517–518}} In a similar token, A. S. Neill founded what became the [[Summerhill School]] in 1921, also declaring being free from coercion.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=518–519}}

Anarchist education is based largely on the idea that a child's right to develop freely and without manipulation ought to be respected and that rationality would lead children to morally good conclusions; however, there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes manipulation. Ferrer believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality, liberty and social justice were not possible under capitalism, along with other critiques of government and nationalism.{{sfnm|1a1=Avrich|1y=1980|1pp=3–33|2a1=Suissa|2y=2019|2pp=519–522}}

Late 20th century and contemporary anarchist writers ([[Paul Goodman]], [[Herbert Read]], and [[Colin Ward]]) intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of state education, largely focusing on the need for a system that focuses on children's creativity rather than on their ability to attain a career or participate in [[consumerism]] as part of a consumer society.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=89–96}} Contemporary anarchists such as Ward claim that state education serves to perpetuate socioeconomic inequality.{{sfn|Ward|1973|pp=39–48}}

While few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modern-day, major tenets of anarchist schools, among them respect for child autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as a teaching method, have spread among mainstream educational institutions. Judith Suissa names three schools as explicitly anarchists schools, namely the Free Skool Santa Cruz in the United States which is part of a wider American-Canadian network of schools, the Self-Managed Learning College in Brighton, England, and the Paideia School in Spain.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=523–526}}

=== Anarchism and the state ===
&lt;!-- Important! Strive to explain how anarchists perceive authority and oppression and why they reject them. Jun (2019), p. 41. --&gt;
Objection to the [[State (polity)|state]] and its institutions is a ''[[sine qua non]]'' of anarchism.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=1971|1p=14|2a1=Jun|2y=2019|2pp=29–30}} Anarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and believe it to be illegitimate regardless of its political tendencies. Instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life, major decisions are taken by a small elite. Authority ultimately rests solely on power, regardless of whether that power is [[Open government|open]] or [[Transparency (behavior)|transparent]], as it still has the ability to coerce people. Another anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting a government, even the most altruistic among officials, will unavoidably seek to gain more power, leading to corruption. Anarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an unachievable fiction due to the fact that the [[ruling class]] is distinct from the rest of society.{{sfn|Jun|2019|pp=32–38}}

Specific anarchist attitudes towards the state vary. [[Robert Paul Wolff]] believed that the tension between authority and autonomy would mean the state could never be legitimate. Bakunin saw the state as meaning &quot;coercion, domination by means of coercion, camouflaged if possible but unceremonious and overt if need be.&quot; [[A. John Simmons]] and [[Leslie Green (philosopher)|Leslie Green]], who leaned toward philosophical anarchism, believed that the state could be legitimate if it is governed by consensus, although they saw this as highly unlikely.{{sfnm|1a1=Wendt|1y=2020|1p=2|2a1=Ashwood|2y=2018|2p=727}} Beliefs on how to abolish the state also differ.{{Sfn|Ashwood|2018|p=735}}

=== Anarchism and the arts ===
{{main|Anarchism and the arts}}
[[File:Apple Harvest by Camille Pissarro.jpg|thumb|340px|''Les chataigniers a Osny'' (1888) by anarchist painter Camille Pissarro is a notable example of blending anarchism and the arts.{{sfn|Antliff|1998|p=99}}]]
The connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism, especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era such as futurists, surrealists and others.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|p=592}} In literature, anarchism was mostly associated with the [[New Apocalyptics]] and the [[neo-romanticism]] movement.{{snf|Gifford|2019|p=577}} In music, anarchism has been associated with music scenes such as punk.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1pp=493–494|2a1=Dunn|2y=2012|3a1=Evren|3a2=Kinna|3a3=Rouselle|3y=2013|p=138}} Anarchists such as [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Herbert Read]] stated that the border between the artist and the non-artist, what separates art from a daily act, is a construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism and it prevents humans from living a joyful life.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|pp=592–593}}

Other anarchists advocated for or used art as a means to achieve anarchist ends.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|p=593}} In his book ''Breaking the Spell: A History of Anarchist Filmmakers, Videotape Guerrillas, and Digital Ninjas'', Chris Robé claims that &quot;anarchist-inflected practices have increasingly structured movement-based video activism.&quot;{{sfn|Robé|2017|p=44}} Throughout the 20th century, many prominent anarchists ([[Peter Kropotkin]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Gustav Landauer]] and [[Camillo Berneri]]) and publications such as ''[[Anarchy (magazine)|Anarchy]]'' wrote about matters pertaining to the arts.{{sfn|Miller|Dirlik|Rosemont|Augustyn|2019|p=1}}

Three overlapping properties made art useful to anarchists. It could depict a critique of existing society and hierarchies, serve as a prefigurative tool to reflect the anarchist ideal society and even turn into a means of direct action such as in protests. As it appeals to both emotion and reason, art could appeal to the whole human and have a powerful effect.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|pp=593–596}} The 19th-century [[neo-impressionist]] movement had an ecological aesthetic and offered an example of an anarchist perception of the road towards socialism.{{sfn|Antliff|1998|p=78}} In ''Les chataigniers a Osny'' by anarchist painter [[Camille Pissarro]], the blending of aesthetic and social harmony is prefiguring an ideal anarchistic agrarian community.{{sfn|Antliff|1998|p=99}}

== Criticism{{anchor|Analysis}}{{anchor|Criticisms}} ==
The most common critique of anarchism is that humans cannot self-govern and so a state is necessary for human survival. Philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] supported this critique, stating that &quot;[p]eace and war, tariffs, regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs, the preservation of a just system of distribution: these, among others, are functions which could hardly be performed in a community in which there was no central government.&quot;{{sfn|Peterson|1987|p=238}}{{better source needed|date=August 2021}} Another common criticism of anarchism is that it fits a world of isolation in which only the small enough entities can be self-governing; a response would be that major anarchist thinkers advocated [[anarchist federalism]].{{sfn|Ward|2004|p=78}}

Philosophy lecturer Andrew G. Fiala composed a list of common arguments against anarchism which includes critiques such as that anarchism is innately related to violence and destruction, not only in the pragmatic world, such as at protests, but in the world of ethics as well. Secondly, anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian since the state can not be defeated practically. This line of arguments most often calls for political action within the system to reform it. The third argument is that anarchism is self-contradictory. While it advocates for no-one to ''archiei'', if accepted by the many, then anarchism would turn into the ruling political theory. In this line of criticism also comes the self-contradiction that anarchism calls for collective action whilst endorsing the autonomy of the individual, hence no collective action can be taken. Lastly, Fiala mentions a critique towards philosophical anarchism of being ineffective (all talk and thoughts) and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong.{{sfn|Fiala|2017|loc=&quot;4. Objections and Replies&quot;}}

Philosophical anarchism has met the criticism of members of academia following the release of pro-anarchist books such as [[A. John Simmons]]' ''Moral Principles and Political Obligations''.{{sfn|Klosko|1999|p=536}} Law professor William A. Edmundson authored an essay to argue against three major philosophical anarchist principles which he finds fallacious. Edmundson says that while the individual does not owe the state a duty of obedience, this does not imply that anarchism is the inevitable conclusion and the state is still morally legitimate.{{sfnm|1a1=Klosko|1y=1999|1p=536|2a1=Kristjánsson|2y=2000|2p=896}} In ''The Problem of Political Authority'', [[Michael Huemer]] defends philosophical anarchism,{{sfn|Dagger|2018|p=35}} claiming that &quot;political authority is a moral illusion.&quot;{{sfn|Rogers|2020|p=}}

One of the earliest criticisms is that anarchism defies and fails to understand the biological inclination to authority.{{sfn|Ferguson|1886}} [[Joseph Raz]] states that the acceptance of authority implies the belief that following their instructions will afford more success.{{sfn|Gans|1992|p=37}} Raz believes that this argument is true in following both authorities' successful and mistaken instruction.{{sfn|Gans|1992|p=38}} Anarchists reject this criticism because challenging or disobeying authority does not entail the disappearance of its advantages by acknowledging authority such as doctors or lawyers as reliable, nor does it involve a complete surrender of independent judgment.{{sfn|Gans|1992|pp=34, 38}} Anarchist perception of human nature, rejection of the state, and commitment to social revolution has been criticised by academics as naive, overly simplistic, and unrealistic, respectively.{{sfn|Brinn|2020|p=206}} Classical anarchism has been criticised for relying too heavily on the belief that the abolition of the state will lead to human cooperation prospering.{{sfn|Lucy|2020|p=162}}

[[Friedrich Engels]], considered to be one of the principal founders of [[Marxism]], criticised anarchism's anti-authoritarianism as inherently counter-revolutionary because in his view a revolution is by itself authoritarian.{{sfn|Tucker|1978}} Academic [[John Molyneux (academic)|John Molyneux]] writes in his book ''Anarchism: A Marxist Criticism'' that &quot;anarchism cannot win&quot;, believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas.{{sfn|Dodds|2011}} The Marxist criticism of anarchism is that it has a utopian character because all individuals should have anarchist views and values. According to the Marxist view, that a social idea would follow directly from this human ideal and out of the free will of every individual formed its essence. Marxists state that this contradiction was responsible for their inability to act. In the anarchist vision, the conflict between liberty and equality was resolved through coexistence and intertwining.{{sfn|Baár|Falina|Janowski|Kopeček|2016|p=488}}

==Characteristics==
Autism is a highly variable [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]&lt;ref name=Geschwind/&gt; whose symptoms first appear during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without [[Remission (medicine)|remission]].&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0/&gt; Autistic people may be severely impaired in some respects but average, or even superior, in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Pinel JP |title=Biopsychology |year=2011 |publisher=Pearson |location=Boston, Massachusetts |edition=8th |isbn=978-0-205-03099-6 |oclc=1085798897 |page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rogers SJ | title = What are infant siblings teaching us about autism in infancy? | journal = Autism Res | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 125–137 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19582867 | pmc = 2791538 | doi = 10.1002/aur.81}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt; It is distinguished by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction, impairments in communication, and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Filipek/&gt; Individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.&lt;ref name=London/&gt;

===Social development===
Social deficits distinguish autism and the related [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD; see [[#Classification|Classification]]) from other developmental disorders.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt; Autistic people have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic [[Temple Grandin]] described her inability to understand the [[social communication]] of [[neurotypical]]s, or people with typical [[neural development]], as leaving her feeling &quot;like an anthropologist on Mars&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Sacks O |author-link=Oliver Sacks |title=An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales |year=1995 |publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-679-43785-7 |oclc=34359253 |lccn=94026733 |title-link=An Anthropologist on Mars}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children with high-functioning autism have more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that autistic children prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for autistic people. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;

{{anchor|Aggression and violence}}
There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with intellectual disability, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and meltdowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Matson JL, Nebel-Schwalm M |title= Assessing challenging behaviors in children with autism spectrum disorders: A review |journal= Research in Developmental Disabilities |volume= 28 |issue=6 |pages= 567–579 |date= November 2007 |pmid= 16973329 |doi= 10.1016/j.ridd.2006.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a pair of studies, high-functioning autistic children aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and as adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension, and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.{{better source needed|date=February 2021}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams DL, Goldstein G, Minshew NJ | title = Neuropsychologic functioning in children with autism: further evidence for disordered complex information-processing | journal = Child Neuropsychol | volume = 12 | issue = 4–5 | pages = 279–298 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16911973 | pmc = 1803025 | doi = 10.1080/09297040600681190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repetitive behavior===
[[File:Autistic-sweetiepie-boy-with-ducksinarow.jpg|thumb|alt=Sleeping boy beside a dozen or so toys arranged in a line|A young autistic boy who has arranged his toys in a row]]
Autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) categorizes as follows.&lt;ref name=Lam-Aman/&gt;

* [[Stereotypy|Stereotyped behaviors]]: Repetitive movements, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking.
* [[Compulsive behavior]]s: Time-consuming behaviors intended to reduce the anxiety that an individual feels compelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules, such as placing objects in a specific order, checking things, or handwashing.
* Sameness: Resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted.
* [[Ritual#Psychology|Ritualistic behavior]]: Unvarying pattern of daily activities, such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual. This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lam-Aman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lam KS, Aman MG | s2cid = 41034513 | title = The Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised: independent validation in individuals with autism spectrum disorders | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 37 | issue = 5 | pages = 855–866 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17048092 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-006-0213-z | url = https://www.academia.edu/14013119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Restricted interests: Interests or fixations that are abnormal in theme or intensity of focus, such as preoccupation with a single television program, toy, or game.
* [[Self-injury]]: Behaviors such as eye-poking, [[Dermatillomania|skin-picking]], hand-biting and head-banging.&lt;ref name=John2007/&gt;

No single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bodfish JW, Symons FJ, Parker DE, Lewis MH | s2cid = 16706630 | title = Varieties of repetitive behavior in autism: comparisons to mental retardation | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 237–243 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11055459 | doi = 10.1023/A:1005596502855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autism's symptoms result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain.&lt;!-- ref name=Penn/ --&gt; How autism occurs is not well understood.

===Classification===
Autism is one of the five [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, severely restricted interests, and highly repetitive behavior.&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0/&gt; These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt;

Of the five PDD forms, [[Asperger syndrome]] is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; [[Rett syndrome]] and [[childhood disintegrative disorder]] share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; [[PDD not otherwise specified]] (PDD-NOS; also called ''atypical autism'') is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Volkmar FR, State M, Klin A | title = Autism and autism spectrum disorders: diagnostic issues for the coming decade | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 108–115 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19220594 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.02010.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in [[language development]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM-IV-TR-299.00&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV |chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 299.00 Autistic Disorder |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 |edition=4th |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-0-89042-025-6 |oclc=768475353 |lccn=00024852 |chapter-url=http://cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131029080544/http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html |archive-date=29 October 2013 |via=Centers for Disease Control}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the ''autism spectrum disorders'' (ASD)&lt;ref name=&quot;CCD2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Myers SM, Johnson CP|date=November 2007|title=Management of children with autism spectrum disorders|url=https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/120/5/1162|journal=Pediatrics|volume=120|issue=5|pages=1162–1182|doi=10.1542/peds.2007-2362|pmid=17967921|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes the ''autistic disorders'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Freitag CM | title = The genetics of autistic disorders and its clinical relevance: a review of the literature | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–22 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17033636 | doi = 10.1038/sj.mp.4001896 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas autism itself is often called ''autistic disorder'', ''childhood autism'', or ''infantile autism''.

==== Spectrum ====
Autism has long been thought to cover a wide [[Spectrum disorder|spectrum]], ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent, [[developmentally disabled]], and prone to frequent repetitive behavior such as hand flapping and rocking—to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, [[pedantic]] communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Happé F | title = Understanding assets and deficits in autism: why success is more interesting than failure | journal = Psychologist | volume = 12 | issue = 11 | pages = 540–547 | year = 1999 | url = http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm/volumeID_12-editionID_46-ArticleID_133-getfile_getPDF/thepsychologist/psy_11_99_p540-547_happe.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120517162434/http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm/volumeID_12-editionID_46-ArticleID_133-getfile_getPDF/thepsychologist/psy_11_99_p540-547_happe.pdf |archive-date=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary.&lt;ref name=Geschwind-2009/&gt;

Several other conditions are common in children with autism.&lt;ref name=Lev2009/&gt; They include:
* '''[[Genetic disorder]]s'''.

* '''[[Anxiety disorder]]s''' are common among children with ASD; there are no firm data, but studies have reported prevalences ranging from 11% to 84%.

* '''Preempted diagnoses'''. Although the DSM-IV rules out the concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism, the full criteria for [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[Tourette syndrome]], and other of these conditions are often present and these [[Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders|co-occurrent conditions]] are increasingly accepted.{{mcn|date=February 2021}}
* '''Sleep problems''' affect about two-thirds of individuals with ASD at some point in childhood. These most commonly include symptoms of [[insomnia]] such as difficulty in falling asleep, frequent [[middle-of-the-night insomnia|nocturnal awakenings]], and early morning awakenings. Sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress, and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary ASD diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Richdale AL, Schreck KA | title = Sleep problems in autism spectrum disorders: prevalence, nature, &amp; possible biopsychosocial aetiologies | journal = Sleep Med Rev | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 403–411 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19398354 | doi = 10.1016/j.smrv.2009.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named. The ''[[Table Talk (Luther)|Table Talk]]'' of [[Martin Luther]], compiled by his notetaker, Mathesius, contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Autism |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=13–23 |year=1997 |doi=10.1177/1362361397011004 |title=The history of ideas on autism: legends, myths and reality | vauthors = Wing L |s2cid=145210370 | author-link1 = Lorna Wing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest well-documented case of autism is that of [[Hugh Blair of Borgue]], as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair's marriage to gain Blair's inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Houston RA, Frith U |title=Autism in History: The Case of Hugh Blair of Borgue |year=2000 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-631-22089-3 |oclc=231866075 |lccn=00036033}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wild Boy of Aveyron]], a [[feral child]] caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student [[Jean Marc Gaspard Itard|Jean Itard]] treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolff&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolff S | s2cid = 6106042 | title = The history of autism | journal = Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 201–208 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15365889 | doi = 10.1007/s00787-004-0363-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Latin]] word ''autismus'' (English translation ''autism'') was coined by the [[Swiss people|Swiss]] psychiatrist [[Eugen Bleuler]] in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of [[schizophrenia]]. He derived it from the Greek word ''autós'' (αὐτός, meaning &quot;self&quot;), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to &quot;autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuhn R | s2cid = 5317716 | title = Eugen Bleuler's concepts of psychopathology | journal = Hist Psychiatry | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 361–366 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15386868 | doi = 10.1177/0957154X04044603}} The quote is a translation of Bleuler's 1910 original.&lt;/ref&gt; A Soviet child psychiatrist, [[Grunya Sukhareva]], described a similar syndrome that was published in Russian in 1925, and in German in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Manouilenko I, Bejerot S|s2cid=207473133|title=Sukhareva—Prior to Asperger and Kanner|journal=Nordic Journal of Psychiatry|type=Report|publication-date=31 March 2015|volume=69|issue=6|pages=1761–1764|doi=10.3109/08039488.2015.1005022|issn=1502-4725|pmid=25826582|year=2015|url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:oru:diva-47358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clinical development and diagnoses ===
[[File:Leo-Kanner.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Balding man in his early 60s in coat and tie, with a serious but slightly smiling expression|[[Leo Kanner]] introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in 1943.]]

The word ''autism'' first took its modern sense in 1938 when [[Hans Asperger]] of the [[Vienna General Hospital|Vienna University Hospital]] adopted Bleuler's terminology ''autistic psychopaths'' in a lecture in German about [[child psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Wien Klin Wochenschr |year=1938 |volume=51 |pages=1314–1317 | title = Das psychisch abnormale Kind |trans-title=The psychically abnormal child | vauthors = Asperger H | author-link1 = Hans Asperger | language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as [[Asperger syndrome]], though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolff&quot;/&gt; [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] first used ''autism'' in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanner1943&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kanner L | author-link1 = Leo Kanner |title=Autistic disturbances of affective contact |journal=Nerv Child |volume=2 |pages=217–250 |year=1943| issue = 4 | pmid = 4880460}} Reprinted in {{cite journal | vauthors = Kanner L | title = Autistic disturbances of affective contact | journal = Acta Paedopsychiatr | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 100–136 | year = 1968 | pmid = 4880460}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably &quot;autistic aloneness&quot; and &quot;insistence on sameness&quot;, are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.&lt;ref name=&quot;HappeTime&quot;/&gt; It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyons V, Fitzgerald M | s2cid = 38130758 | title = Asperger (1906–1980) and Kanner (1894–1981), the two pioneers of autism | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 37 | issue = 10 | pages = 2022–2023 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17922179 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-007-0383-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanner's reuse of ''autism'' led to decades of confused terminology like ''infantile schizophrenia'', and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to &quot;[[refrigerator mother]]s&quot;. Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fombonne E | s2cid = 8868418 | title = Modern views of autism | journal = Can J Psychiatry | volume = 48 | issue = 8 | pages = 503–505 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14574825 | url = http://ww1.cpa-apc.org/Publications/Archives/CJP/2003/september/guesteditorial.asp| doi = 10.1177/070674370304800801| doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Terminology and distinction from schizophrenia ===
As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; while in 2007 it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |chapter=Genetic epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders | vauthors = Szatmari P, Jones MB | author-link1 = Peter Szatmari | pages=157–178 |title=Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders |edition=2nd | veditors = Volkmar FR |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-521-54957-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have affected how ASD is viewed,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolff&quot;/&gt; parents continue to feel [[social stigma]] in situations where their child's autistic behavior is perceived negatively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chambres P, Auxiette C, Vansingle C, Gil S | s2cid = 19769173 | title = Adult attitudes toward behaviors of a six-year-old boy with autism | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 1320–1327 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18297387 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-007-0519-5 | url = https://www.academia.edu/20027016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many [[primary care physician]]s and [[medical specialist]]s express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heidgerken AD, Geffken G, Modi A, Frakey L | s2cid = 2015723 | title = A survey of autism knowledge in a health care setting | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 323–330 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16119473 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-005-3298-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It took until 1980 for the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-III]] to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia. In 1987, the [[DSM-III-R]] provided a checklist for diagnosing autism. In May 2013, the DSM-5 was released, updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders. The grouping of disorders, including PDD-NOS, autism, Asperger syndrome, Rett syndrome, and CDD, has been removed and replaced with the general term of Autism Spectrum Disorders. The two categories that exist are impaired social communication and/or interaction, and restricted and/or repetitive behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baker JP | title = Autism at 70—redrawing the boundaries | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 12 | pages = 1089–1091 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 24047057 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp1306380 | s2cid = 44613078 | url = http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/daf7/ff077eb74aa9a1afdc70c101581e1b128ca3.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190307045533/http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/daf7/ff077eb74aa9a1afdc70c101581e1b128ca3.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2019-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Autism rights movement ===
The [[autism rights movement]] is a [[social movement]] within the context of [[disability rights movement|disability right]]s that emphasizes the concept of [[neurodiversity]], viewing the autism spectrum as a result of natural variations in the [[human brain]] rather than a disorder to be cured.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solomon&quot;/&gt; The autism rights movement advocates for including greater acceptance of autistic behaviors; therapies that focus on coping skills rather than on imitating the behaviors of those without autism, and the recognition of the autistic community as a [[minority group]].&lt;ref name= Jaarsma2012&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jaarsma P, Welin S | s2cid = 18618887 | title = Autism as a natural human variation: reflections on the claims of the neurodiversity movement | journal = Health Care Analysis | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–30 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 21311979 | doi = 10.1007/s10728-011-0169-9 | url = http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-72172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the [[human genome]]. This perspective is distinct from [[fringe theories]] that autism is caused by environmental factors such as [[vaccine]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solomon&quot;/&gt; A common criticism against autistic activists is that the majority of them are &quot;[[High-functioning autism|high-functioning]]&quot; or have Asperger syndrome and do not represent the views of &quot;[[Low-functioning autism|low-functioning]]&quot; autistic people.&lt;ref name= Jaarsma2012/&gt;

[[File:Albedo-e hg.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The percentage of [[diffuse reflection|diffusely reflected]] [[sunlight]] relative to various surface conditions]]

'''Albedo''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|b|iː|d|oʊ}}; {{etymology|la|albedo|whiteness}}) is the measure of the [[diffuse reflection]] of [[sunlight|solar radiation]] out of the total [[solar radiation]] and measured on a scale from 0, corresponding to a [[black body]] that absorbs all incident radiation, to 1, corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation.

Surface albedo is defined as the ratio of [[Radiosity (radiometry)|radiosity]] ''J''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; to the [[irradiance]] ''E''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; (flux per unit area) received by a surface.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parent.1/classes/782/Lectures/03_Radiometry.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself, but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://curry.eas.gatech.edu/Courses/6140/ency/Chapter9/Ency_Atmos/Reflectance_Albedo_Surface.pdf |title=Reflectance and albedo, surface |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Atmosphere |editor=J. R. Holton |editor2=J. A. Curry |last=Coakley |first=J. A. |publisher=Academic Press |year=2003|pages=1914–1923}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors vary with atmospheric composition, geographic location and time (see [[position of the Sun]]). While bi-hemispherical [[reflectance]] is calculated for a single angle of incidence (i.e., for a given position of the Sun), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period. The temporal resolution may range from seconds (as obtained from flux measurements) to daily, monthly, or annual averages.

Unless given for a specific wavelength (spectral albedo), albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Henderson-Sellers |first1=A. |last2=Wilson |first2=M. F.|year=1983 |quote=Albedo observations of the Earth's surface for climate research |jstor=37357 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A |volume=309 |issue=1508 |title=The Study of the Ocean and the Land Surface from Satellites |pages=285–294 |bibcode=1983RSPTA.309..285H |doi=10.1098/rsta.1983.0042|s2cid=122094064 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to measurement constraints, it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface (between 0.3 and 3 μm). This spectrum includes [[visible spectrum|visible light]] (0.4–0.7 μm), which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark (e.g., trees absorb most radiation), whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright (e.g., snow reflects most radiation).

Albedo is an important concept in [[climatology]], [[astronomy]], and environmental management (e.g., as part of the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) program for sustainable rating of buildings). The average albedo of the Earth from the upper atmosphere, its ''planetary albedo'', is 30–35% because of [[cloud cover]], but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Environmental Encyclopedia |url=https://archive.org/details/environmentalenc01cunn |url-access=registration |edition=3rd |publisher=Thompson Gale |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7876-5486-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term albedo was introduced into optics by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] in his 1760 work ''[[Photometria]]''.

Any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about 0.9 for fresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a [[black body]]. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4.&lt;ref name=&quot;PhysicsWorld&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Albedo.html |title=Albedo – from Eric Weisstein's World of Physics |publisher=Scienceworld.wolfram.com |access-date=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 0.3.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goode&quot;/&gt; This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.

[[File:Ceres 2003 2004 clear sky total sky albedo.png|thumb|upright=1.2|left|2003–2004 mean annual clear-sky and total-sky albedo]]
Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via [[Earth observation]] satellite sensors such as [[NASA]]'s [[MODIS]] instruments on board the [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] and [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellites, and the CERES instrument on the [[Suomi NPP]] and [[Joint Polar Satellite System|JPSS]]. As the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite, not all directions, a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.,&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA&quot;/&gt;). These calculations are based on the [[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF), which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle. BDRF can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo.

Earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the [[greenhouse effect]] is currently about {{convert|15|C|F}}. If Earth were frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective), the average temperature of the planet would drop below {{convert|-40|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;washington&quot; /&gt; If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about {{convert|0|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;clim-past&quot;/&gt; In contrast, if the entire Earth was covered by water – a so-called [[ocean planet]] – the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost {{convert|27|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith Robin&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!--===Variability and recent/spatiotemporal changes===--&gt;
In 2021, scientists reported that Earth dimmed by ~0.5% over two decades (1998-2017) as measured by earthshine using modern photometric techniques. This may have both been co-caused by [[climate change]] as well as substantially increase global warming. However, the link to climate change has not been explored to date and it is unclear whether or not this represents an ongoing trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gray |first1=Jennifer |title=The Earth isn't as bright as it once was |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/04/weather/earth-dimming-climate/index.html |access-date=19 October 2021 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goode |first1=P.

===White-sky, black-sky, and blue-sky albedo===
For land surfaces, it has been shown that the albedo at a particular [[solar zenith angle]] ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms:
* the [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] at that solar zenith angle, &lt;math&gt;{\bar \alpha(\theta_i)}&lt;/math&gt;, sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo, and
* the [[bi-hemispherical reflectance]], &lt;math&gt;\bar{ \bar \alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, sometimes referred to as white-sky albedo.
with &lt;math&gt;{1-D}&lt;/math&gt; being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle, and &lt;math&gt;{D}&lt;/math&gt; being the proportion of diffuse illumination, the actual albedo &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; (also called blue-sky albedo) can then be given as:

:&lt;math&gt;{\alpha}= (1-D) \bar \alpha(\theta_i) + D \bar{ \bar \alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;BlueskyAlbedo&quot;/&gt;

== Astronomical albedo ==

The albedos of [[planet]]s, [[Natural satellite|satellites]] and [[minor planet]]s such as [[asteroid]]s can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle (&quot;phase angle&quot;), and variation in time composes a major part of the astronomical field of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer [[Solar System]] objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about [[regolith]] properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in [[asteroid]]s.

[[Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar System, with an albedo of 0.99. Another notable high-albedo body is [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], with an albedo of 0.96.&lt;ref name=&quot;sicardy&quot;&gt;

Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) [[geometric albedo]] (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the [[Bond albedo]] (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.

In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five [[Hapke parameters]] which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]], including a characterization of the opposition effect of [[regolith]] surfaces.

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the astronomical albedo, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the diameter in kilometers, and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute magnitude.

==Examples of terrestrial albedo effects==

===Illumination===
Albedo is not directly dependent on illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light, except in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the Earth's surface at that location (e.g. through melting of reflective ice). That said, albedo and illumination both vary by latitude. Albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics, with a local maximum in the tropics.&lt;ref name=Winston&gt;{{cite journal| first=Jay |last=Winston |title=The Annual Course of Zonal Mean Albedo as Derived From ESSA 3 and 5 Digitized Picture Data |journal=Monthly Weather Review |volume=99 |pages=818–827| bibcode=1971MWRv...99..818W| date=1971| doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1971)099&lt;0818:TACOZM&gt;2.3.CO;2| issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insolation effects===
The intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local [[insolation]] (solar irradiance); high albedo areas in the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] regions are cold due to low insolation, whereas areas such as the [[Sahara Desert]], which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation. [[Tropical]] and [[sub-tropical]] [[rainforest]] areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their [[temperate forest]] counterparts, which have lower insolation. Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb, effectively cooling the [[Earth]]. This has been a concern since arctic ice and [[snow]] has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures, creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker (being water or ground which is darker color) and reflects less heat back into space. This [[Ice–albedo feedback|feedback loop]] results in a reduced albedo effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21721364-commercial-opportunities-are-vastly-outweighed-damage-climate-thawing-arctic|title=The thawing Arctic threatens an environmental catastrophe|newspaper=The Economist|access-date=8 May 2017|date=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate and weather===
Albedo affects [[climate]] by determining how much [[radiation]] a planet absorbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=av7q4N8Ib6sC&amp;pg=PA53|title=Encyclopedia of Climate and Weather: Abs-Ero|last1=Schneider|first1=Stephen Henry|last2=Mastrandrea|first2=Michael D.|last3=Root|first3=Terry L.|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-976532-4|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uneven heating of Earth from albedo variations between land, ice, or ocean surfaces can drive [[weather]].

===Albedo–temperature feedback===
When an area's albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow–temperature [[feedback]] results. A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g., a warm [[air mass]]), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow–temperature feedback. However, because local [[weather]] is dynamic due to the change of [[season]]s, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher [[insolation]]) cause melting. When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass, soil, or ocean, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.

===Snow===
Snow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hall |first1=Dorothy K. |author-link=Dorothy Hall (scientist)|title=Remote Sensing of Ice and Snow |date=1985 |publisher=Springer Netherlands |location=Dordrecht |isbn=978-94-009-4842-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over [[Antarctica]] snow albedo averages a little more than 0.8. If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the ice–albedo [[positive feedback]]).

Just as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow, the albedo of snow-covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water. Sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow. When sea ice melts, either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above, the snow-covered surface is reduced, and more surface of sea water is exposed, so the rate of energy absorption increases. The extra absorbed energy heats the sea water, which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts. As with the preceding example of snowmelt, the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;All About Sea Ice.&quot; National Snow and Ice Data Center. Accessed 16 November 2017. /cryosphere/seaice/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important for [[global warming]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

[[Cryoconite]], powdery windblown [[dust]] containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.&lt;ref name = &quot;Nat. Geo&quot;&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/06/melt-zone/jenkins-text/3 &quot;Changing Greenland – Melt Zone&quot;] page 3, of 4, article by Mark Jenkins in ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' June 2010, accessed 8 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback, together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo, can lead to large errors in energy estimates. Because of this, in order to reduce the error of energy estimates, it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Small-scale effects===
Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.&lt;ref name=&quot;ranknfile-ue&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ranknfile-ue.org/h&amp;s0897.html |title=Health and Safety: Be Cool! (August 1997) |publisher=Ranknfile-ue.org |access-date=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar photovoltaic effects ===
Albedo can affect the [[electrical energy]] output of solar [[photovoltaic system|photovoltaic devices]]. For example, the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions. Research showed impacts of over 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andrews | first1 = Rob W. | last2 = Pearce | first2 = Joshua M. | date = 2013 | title = The effect of spectral albedo on amorphous silicon and crystalline silicon solar photovoltaic device performance | journal = Solar Energy | volume = 91 | pages = 233–241 | doi = 10.1016/j.solener.2013.01.030 |bibcode = 2013SoEn...91..233A | url = https://www.academia.edu/3081684 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both human-made and natural) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brennan | first1 = M.P. | author-link4 = J.

===Trees===
Because forests generally have a low albedo, (the majority of the ultraviolet and [[visible spectrum]] is absorbed through [[photosynthesis]]), some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of [[afforestation]] (or offset the negative climate impacts of [[deforestation]]). In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Betts&quot; /&gt; Trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through [[evapotranspiration]]. The water vapor causes cooling on the land surface, causes heating where it condenses, acts a strong greenhouse gas, and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boucher | date = 2004 | title = Direct human influence of irrigation on atmospheric water vapour and climate | journal = Climate Dynamics | volume = 22 | issue = 6–7| pages = 597–603 | doi=10.1007/s00382-004-0402-4|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2004ClDy...22..597B | s2cid = 129640195 | url = https://www.academia.edu/25329256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact, and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonan | first1 = GB | date = 2008 | title = Forests and Climate Change: Forcings, Feedbacks, and the Climate Benefits of Forests | journal = Science | volume = 320 | issue = 5882| pages = 1444–1449 | doi = 10.1126/science.1155121 | pmid=18556546|bibcode = 2008Sci...320.1444B  | s2cid = 45466312 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1230896 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. [[Deciduous trees]] have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas [[coniferous trees]] have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.&lt;ref name=&quot;mmutrees&quot; /&gt; Variation in summer albedo across both forest types is associated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high growth capacity display a greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ollinger&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that wavelengths of light not used in photosynthesis are more likely to be reflected back to space rather than being absorbed by other surfaces lower in the canopy.

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g., Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Betts&quot; /&gt;

===Water===
[[File:water reflectivity.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Reflectivity of smooth water at {{convert|20|C|F}} (refractive index=1.333)]]
Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the [[Fresnel equations]].

At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally [[specular reflection|specular manner]] (not [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely]]). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small [[angle of incidence (optics)|angles of incident]] light, [[waviness]] results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fresnel&quot; /&gt;

Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.

Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh 'black' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.
Snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to 0.9.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Clouds===
[[Cloud albedo]] has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. &quot;On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;livescience&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/060124_earth_albedo.html |title=Baffled Scientists Say Less Sunlight Reaching Earth |publisher=LiveScience |date=24 January 2006 |access-date=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Contrails reduce daily temperature range|url=http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf|journal=Nature |access-date=7 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503192714/http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf|archive-date=3 May 2006|page=601|volume=418|issue=6898|date=8 August 2002|url-status=dead|doi=10.1038/418601a|bibcode = 2002Natur.418..601T|pmid=12167846|last1=Travis|first1=D.

===Aerosol effects===
[[Aerosols]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on Earth's radiative balance. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[cloud condensation nuclei]] and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain.&lt;ref name=&quot;girda&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671 |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |access-date=19 August 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175429/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm| archive-date= 29 June 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per Spracklen et al.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOMINICK&quot; /&gt; the effects are:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- Aerosol radiative forcing. --&gt;
* ''Aerosol direct effect.'' Aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation. The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming.
* ''Aerosol indirect effect.'' Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called [[cloud condensation nuclei]]. Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations, which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and radiative cooling (''first indirect effect''), but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud (''second indirect effect'').
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In extremely polluted cities like [[Delhi]], aerosol pollutants influence local weather and induce an [[Urban heat island#Urban cold island|urban cool island]] effect during the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Masson|first1=Valéry|last2=Lemonsu|first2=Aude|last3=Hidalgo|first3=Julia|last4=Voogt|first4=James|date=2020-10-17|title=Urban Climates and Climate Change|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|language=en|volume=45|issue=1|pages=411–444|doi=10.1146/annurev-environ-012320-083623|doi-access=free|issn=1543-5938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black carbon===
Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from [[black carbon]] particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] estimates that the global mean [[radiative forcing]] for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;girda 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |access-date=19 August 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629180154/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm| archive-date= 29 June 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo.&lt;ref&gt;James Hansen &amp; Larissa Nazarenko, ''Soot Climate Forcing Via Snow and Ice Albedos'', 101 Proc. of the Nat'l. Acad. of Sci. 423 (13 January 2004) (&quot;The efficacy of this forcing is »2 (i.e., for a given forcing it is twice as effective as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in altering global surface air temperature)&quot;); ''compare'' Zender Testimony, ''supra'' note 7, at 4 (figure 3); See J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko, ''supra'' note 18, at 426. (&quot;The efficacy for changes of Arctic sea ice albedo is &gt;3. In additional runs not shown here, we found that the efficacy of albedo changes in Antarctica is also &gt;3.&quot;); ''See also'' Flanner, M.G., C.S. Zender, J.T. Randerson, and P.J. Rasch, ''Present-day climate forcing and response from black carbon in snow'', 112 J. GEOPHYS. RES. D11202 (2007) (&quot;The forcing is maximum coincidentally with snowmelt onset, triggering strong snow-albedo feedback in local springtime. Consequently, the &quot;efficacy&quot; of black carbon/snow forcing is more than three times greater than forcing by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2020}}

===Human activities===
Human activities (e.g., deforestation, farming, and urbanization) change the albedo of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult, further study is required to determine anthropogenic effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Sagan|first1=Carl|last2=Toon|first2=Owen B.|last3=Pollack|first3=James B.|date=1979|title=Anthropogenic Albedo Changes and the Earth's Climate|journal=Science|volume=206|issue=4425|pages=1363–1368|issn=0036-8075|jstor=1748990|doi=10.1126/science.206.4425.1363|pmid=17739279|bibcode=1979Sci...206.1363S|s2cid=33810539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other types of albedo==
[[Single-scattering albedo]] is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material ([[refractive index]]); the size of the particle or particles; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.

'''A''', or '''a''', is the first [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] and the first [[vowel]] of the [[English alphabet|modern English alphabet]] and the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Latin-alphabet|title=Latin alphabet &amp;#124; Definition, Description, History, &amp; Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; Its name in English is [[English alphabet#Letter names|''a'']] (pronounced {{IPAc-en|'|eɪ}}), plural [[English alphabet#Letter names|''aes'']].{{refn|group=nb|''Aes'' is the plural of the name of the letter. The plural of the letter itself is rendered ''A''s, A's, ''a''s, or a's.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|Weiner|1989|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} It is similar in shape to the [[Greek alphabet#History|Ancient Greek letter]] [[alpha]], from which it derives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCarter|1974|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Letter case|uppercase]] version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. The lowercase version can be written in two forms: the double-storey '''a''' and single-storey '''ɑ'''. The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in [[italic type]].

In the English grammar, &quot;[[English articles|a]]&quot;, and its variant &quot;[[English articles#Indefinite article|an]]&quot;, are [[Article (grammar)#Indefinite article|indefinite articles]].

The earliest certain ancestor of &quot;A&quot; is [[aleph]] (also written 'aleph), the first letter of the [[Phoenician alphabet]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consisted entirely of [[consonant]]s (for that reason, it is also called an [[abjad]] to distinguish it from a true [[alphabet]]). In turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been a [[pictogram]] of an ox head in [[proto-Sinaitic script]]&lt;ref name=Coll&gt;{{harvnb|Hall-Quest|1997|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; influenced by [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], styled as a triangular head with two horns extended.

When the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] adopted the alphabet, they had no use for a letter to represent the [[glottal stop]]—the consonant sound that the letter denoted in [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] and other [[Semitic languages]], and that was the first [[phoneme]] of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter—so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel {{IPA|/a/}}, and called it by the similar name of [[alpha]]. In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the [[Greek Dark Ages]], dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the [[Greek alphabet]] of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.

The [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the [[Italian Peninsula]] and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the [[Old Italic script|Etruscan alphabet]] to write the [[Latin|Latin language]], and the resulting letter was preserved in the [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] that would come to be used to write many languages, including English.

===Typographic variants===
[[File:A-small glyphs.svg|thumb|140px|Different [[glyphs]] of the lowercase letter A.]]
During Roman times, there were many variant forms of the letter &quot;A&quot;. First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other &quot;permanent&quot; media. There was also a [[cursive]] style used for everyday or utilitarian writing, which was done on more perishable surfaces. Due to the &quot;perishable&quot; nature of these surfaces, there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive, such as [[letter case|majuscule]] cursive, [[letter case|minuscule]] cursive, and semicursive minuscule. Variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles. The known variants include the early [[Uncial script#Half-uncial|semi-uncial]], the uncial, and the later semi-uncial.&lt;ref name=Americana&gt;{{harvnb|Diringer|2000|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LowercaseA.svg|left|thumb|[[Allography|Typographic variants]] include a double-storey '''a''' and single-storey '''ɑ'''.]]
At the end of the [[Roman Empire]] (5th century AD), several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe. Among these were the semicursive minuscule of [[Italy]], the [[Merovingian script]] in France, the [[Visigothic script]] in Spain, and the [[Insular script|Insular]] or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule of Great Britain. By the 9th century, the [[Carolingian minuscule|Caroline script]], which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. This form was derived through a combining of prior forms.&lt;ref name=Americana/&gt;

[[File:Road sign on the R639 north of Urlingford, Ireland - 20090502.jpg|thumb|right|Road sign in Ireland, showing the Irish &quot;Latin alpha&quot; form of &quot;a&quot; in lower and upper case forms.]]
15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today. These variants, the ''Italic'' and ''Roman'' forms, were derived from the Caroline Script version. The Italic form, also called ''script a,'' is used in most current [[handwriting]]; it consists of a circle and vertical stroke on the right (&quot;ɑ&quot;). This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter [[tau]] in the hands of medieval Irish and English writers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; The Roman form is used in most printed material; it consists of a small loop with an arc over it (&quot;a&quot;).&lt;ref name=Americana/&gt; Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the [[serif]] that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form. Graphic designers refer to the ''Italic'' and ''Roman'' forms as &quot;single decker a&quot; and &quot;double decker a&quot; respectively.

[[Italic type]] is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest (set in Roman type). There are some other cases aside from italic type where ''script a'' (&quot;ɑ&quot;), also called [[Latin alpha]], is used in contrast with Latin &quot;a&quot; (such as in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]).

==Use in writing systems==
[[File:Pronunciation of the name of the letter ⟨a⟩ in European languages.png|thumb|Pronunciation of the name of the letter {{angbr|a}} in European languages, note that /a/ and /aː/ can differ phonetically between {{IPAblink|a}}, {{IPAblink|ä}}, {{IPAblink|æ}} and {{IPAblink|ɑ}} depending on the language.|305x305px]]

===English===
{{further|Pronunciation of English ⟨a⟩}}
In modern [[English orthography]], the letter {{angbr|a}} represents at least seven different vowel sounds:
*the [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/æ/}} as in ''pad'';
*the [[open back unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/ɑː/}} as in ''father'', which is closer to its original Latin and Greek sound;&lt;ref name=Coll/&gt;
*the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/eɪ/}} as in ''ace'' and ''major'' (usually when {{vr|a}} is followed by one, or occasionally two, consonants and then another vowel letter) – this results from [[Middle English lengthening]] followed by the [[Great Vowel Shift]];
*the modified form of the above sound that occurs [[English-language vowel changes before historic /r/|before {{vr|r}}]], as in ''square'' and ''Mary'';
*the rounded vowel of ''water'';
*the shorter rounded vowel (not present in [[General American]]) in ''was'' and ''what'';&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt;
*a [[schwa]], in many unstressed syllables, as in ''about'', ''comma'', ''solar''.

The double {{angbr|aa}} sequence does not occur in native English words, but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as ''Aaron'' and ''[[aardvark]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gelb|Whiting|1998|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, {{vr|a}} occurs in [[List of Latin-script digraphs|many common digraphs]], all with their own sound or sounds, particularly {{vr|ai}}, {{vr|au}}, {{vr|aw}}, {{vr|ay}}, {{vr|ea}} and {{vr|oa}}.

{{angbr|a}} is the third-most-commonly used letter in English (after {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|t}}),&lt;ref name=&quot;Trinity College 2006&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Trinity College|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second most common in Spanish and French. In one study, on average, about 3.68% of letters used in English texts tend to be {{angbr|a}}, while the number is 6.22% in Spanish and 3.95% in French.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trinity College 2006&quot;/&gt;

===Other languages===
In most languages that use the Latin alphabet, {{angbr|a}} denotes an open unrounded vowel, such as {{IPA|/[[Open front unrounded vowel|a]]/}}, {{IPA|/[[Open central unrounded vowel|ä]]/}}, or {{IPA|/[[Open back unrounded vowel|ɑ]]/}}. An exception is [[Saanich dialect|Saanich]], in which {{angbr|a}} (and the glyph [[Á]]) stands for a [[close-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/e/}}.

===Other systems===

In phonetic and phonemic notation:
*in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], {{angbr IPA|a}} is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]], {{angbr IPA|ä}} is used for the [[open central unrounded vowel]], and {{angbr IPA|ɑ}} is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].
*in [[X-SAMPA]], {{angbr|a}} is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]] and {{angbr|A}} is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].

==Other uses==
{{main article|A (disambiguation)}}
In [[algebra]], the letter ''a'' along with various other letters of the alphabet is often used to denote a [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]], with various conventional meanings in different areas of mathematics. Moreover, in 1637, René Descartes &quot;invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by x, y, and z, and knowns by a, b, and c&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Tom Sorell, ''Descartes: A Very Short Introduction'', (2000). New York: Oxford University Press. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; and this convention is still often followed, especially in elementary algebra.

In [[geometry]], capital A, B, C etc. are used to denote [[Line segment|segment]]s, [[line (geometry)|line]]s, [[Line (geometry)#Ray|rays]], etc.&lt;ref name=Americana/&gt; A capital A is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a [[triangle]], the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle A.&lt;ref name=Coll/&gt;

&quot;A&quot; is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A-, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students' schoolwork; &quot;A grade&quot; for clean restaurants; [[A-list]] celebrities, etc. Such associations can have a [[motivation|motivating]] effect, as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ciani &amp; Sheldon|2010|pp=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;A&quot; is used as a prefix on some words, such as [[asymmetry]], to mean &quot;not&quot; or &quot;without&quot; (from Greek).

In English grammar, &quot;a&quot;, and its variant &quot;an&quot;, is an [[Article (grammar)#Indefinite article|indefinite article]], used to introduce noun phrases.

Finally, the letter A is used to denote size, as in a narrow size shoe,&lt;ref name=Coll/&gt; or a small cup size in a [[brassiere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Luciani |first=Jené |title=The Bra Book: The Fashion Formula to Finding the Perfect Bra |date=2009 |publisher=Benbella Books |isbn=9781933771946 |location=Dallas, TX |pages=13 |language=en |oclc=317453115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alabama''' ({{IPAc-en|,|æ|l|ə|'|b|æ|m|ə|}}) is a state in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeastern]] region of the [[United States]], bordered by [[Tennessee]] to the north; [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to the east; [[Florida]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the south; and [[Mississippi]] to the west. Alabama is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|30th largest by area]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|24th-most populous]] of the [[List of states and territories of the United States|U.S. states]].

Alabama is nicknamed the ''[[Northern flicker|Yellowhammer]] State'', after the [[List of U.S. state birds|state bird]]. Alabama is also known as the &quot;Heart of [[Dixie]]&quot; and the &quot;Cotton State&quot;. The [[List of U.S. state and territory trees|state tree]] is the [[longleaf pine]], and the [[List of U.S. state and territory flowers|state flower]] is the [[camellia]].

The state's geography is diverse, with the north dominated by the mountainous [[Tennessee Valley]] and the south by [[Mobile Bay]], a historically significant port. Politically, as part of the [[Deep South]], Alabama is now a predominantly [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] state, and it is known for its [[Culture of the Southern United States|Southern culture]]. Today, [[American football]], particularly at the college level at schools like [[Auburn University]], the [[University of Alabama]], [[Alabama A&amp;M University]], [[Alabama State University]], [[Troy University]], the [[University of South Alabama]], and [[Jacksonville State University]] is a major part of the state's culture.

Originally home to many native tribes, present-day Alabama was a Spanish territory beginning in the sixteenth century until the French acquired it in the early eighteenth century. The British won the territory in 1763 until losing it in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Spain held Mobile as part of [[Spanish West Florida]] until 1813. In December 1819, Alabama was recognized as a state. During the antebellum period, Alabama was a major [[Cotton production in the United States|producer of cotton]], and widely used [[African Americans|African American]] [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] labor. In 1861, the state seceded from the United States to become part of the [[Confederate States of America]], with Montgomery acting as its first capital, and rejoined the Union in 1868.

From the [[American Civil War]] until [[World War II]], Alabama suffered economic hardship, in part because of its continued dependence on few agricultural cash crops. Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed [[Jim Crow laws]] to disenfranchise and discriminate against African Americans from the end of the [[Reconstruction Era]] up until the 1960s. Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, [[White Americans|white]] rural interests dominated the state legislature from 1901 to the 1960s. During this time, urban interests and African Americans were markedly under-represented. High-profile events such as the [[Selma to Montgomery march]] made the state a major focal point of the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Following World War II, Alabama grew as the state's economy diversified. The state's economy in the 21st century is based on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;alaindustrial&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |title=Alabama Occupational Projections 2008–2018 |website=Alabama Department of Industrial Relations |publisher=State of Alabama |access-date=September 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117053325/http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |archive-date=January 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The European-American naming of the [[Alabama River]] and state was derived from the [[Alabama people]], a [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean-speaking tribe]] whose members lived just below the [[confluence]] of the [[Coosa River|Coosa]] and [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] rivers on the upper reaches of the river.&lt;ref name=&quot;Read&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Read |first=William A. |title=Indian Place Names in Alabama |year=1984 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |isbn=978-0-8173-0231-3 |oclc=10724679}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Alabama language]], the word for a person of Alabama lineage is {{lang|akz|Albaamo}} (or variously {{lang|akz|Albaama}} or {{lang|akz|Albàamo}} in different dialects; the plural form is {{lang|akz|Albaamaha}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Sylestine, Cora |author2=Hardy, Heather |author3=[[Timothy Montler|Montler, Timothy]] |title=Dictionary of the Alabama Language |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-292-73077-9 |url=http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |oclc=26590560 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024054330/http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |archive-date=October 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suggestion that &quot;Alabama&quot; was borrowed from the [[Choctaw language]] is unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/248152?redirectedFrom=alabama&amp; &quot;Alabama, n. and adj.&quot;].

Sources disagree on the word's meaning.

[[Indigenous peoples]] of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of European colonization. Trade with the northeastern tribes by the [[Ohio River]] began during the Burial Mound Period (1000{{nbs}}BCE{{snd}}700{{nbs}}CE) and continued until [[European colonization of the Americas|European contact]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorkTimesAlmanac&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://travel2.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/NYT_ALMANAC_US_ALABAMA.html |title=Alabama |date=August 11, 2006 |work=The New York Times Almanac 2004 |access-date=September 23, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016195242/http://travel2.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/NYT_ALMANAC_US_ALABAMA.html |archive-date=October 16, 2013 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agrarian [[Mississippian culture]] covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 CE, with one of its major centers built at what is now the [[Moundville Archaeological Site]] in [[Moundville, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Welch |first= Paul D. |title= Moundville's Economy |publisher= University of Alabama Press |year= 1991 |isbn= 978-0-8173-0512-3 |oclc= 21330955}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Walthall |first= John A. |title= Prehistoric Indians of the Southeast-Archaeology of Alabama and the Middle South |publisher= University of Alabama Press |year= 1990 |isbn= 978-0-8173-0552-9 |oclc= 26656858}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the second-largest complex of the classic Middle Mississippian era, after [[Cahokia]] in present-day [[Illinois]], which was the center of the culture.

The Spanish were the first Europeans to reach Alabama during their exploration of North America in the 16th century. The expedition of Hernando de Soto passed through [[Mabila]] and other parts of the state in 1540.

After the French lost to the British in the [[Seven Years' War]], it became part of British [[West Florida]] from 1763 to 1783. After the United States victory in the [[American Revolutionary War]], the territory was divided between the United States and Spain.

Thomas Bassett, a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]] to the British monarchy during the Revolutionary era, was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside Mobile.

What is now the counties of [[Baldwin County, Alabama|Baldwin]] and Mobile became part of Spanish West Florida in 1783, part of the independent [[Republic of West Florida]] in 1810, and was finally added to the [[Mississippi Territory]] in 1812. Most of what is now the northern two-thirds of Alabama was known as the [[Yazoo lands]] beginning during the British colonial period. It was claimed by the [[Province of Georgia]] from 1767 onwards. Following the Revolutionary War, it remained a part of Georgia, although heavily disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cadle |first=Farris W |title=Georgia Land Surveying History and Law|year=1991 |publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, Ga.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pickett&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Pickett |first=Albert James |title=History of Alabama and incidentally of Georgia and Mississippi, from the earliest period|url=https://archive.org/details/historyalabamaa00pickgoog |year=1851 |publisher=Walker and James|location=Charleston|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyalabamaa00pickgoog/page/n432 408]–428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Mississippi's admission to statehood on December 10, 1817, the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the [[Alabama Territory]]. The [[United States Congress]] created the Alabama Territory on March 3, 1817. [[St. Stephens, Alabama|St. Stephens]], now abandoned, served as the territorial capital from 1817 to 1819.&lt;ref name=&quot;eoaststephens&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1674 |title=Old St. Stephens |website=Encyclopedia of Alabama |publisher=Auburn University |access-date=June 21, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726152101/http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1674 |archive-date=July 26, 2011 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama was admitted as the 22nd state on December 14, 1819, with Congress selecting Huntsville as the site for the first Constitutional Convention. From July{{nbs}}5 to August 2, 1819, delegates met to prepare the new state constitution.

By 1860, the population had increased to 964,201 people, of which nearly half, 435,080, were enslaved African Americans, and 2,690 were [[free people of color]].&lt;ref name=&quot;adahtmln&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.alabama.gov/timeline/al1801.html |title=Alabama History Timeline |website=Alabama Department of Archives and History |publisher=State of Alabama |access-date=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 11, 1861, Alabama declared its [[Secession in the United States|secession]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. After remaining an independent republic for a few days, it joined the Confederate States of America. The Confederacy's capital was initially at Montgomery. Alabama was heavily [[Alabama in the American Civil War|involved in the American Civil War]]. Although comparatively few battles were fought in the state, Alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the war effort.

From 1867 to 1874, with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised, many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state. Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African-American congressmen: [[Jeremiah Haralson]], [[Benjamin S. Turner]], and [[James T.

Following the war, the state remained chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton. During Reconstruction, state legislators ratified a [[Constitution of Alabama|new state constitution]] in 1868 which created the state's first public school system and expanded women's rights. Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects, although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and [[misappropriation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alrecnstrctn&quot;/&gt; Organized [[Insurgency|insurgent]], resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans.

Reconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874, when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governor's office through an election dominated by fraud and violence. They wrote another constitution in 1875,&lt;ref name=&quot;alrecnstrctn&quot;/&gt; and the legislature passed the [[Blaine Amendment]], prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious-affiliated schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schoolreport.com/schoolreport/articles/blaine_7_00.htm |title=A Blaine Amendment Update (July 00) |publisher=Schoolreport.com |access-date=June 1, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716014339/http://www.schoolreport.com/schoolreport/articles/blaine_7_00.htm |archive-date=July 16, 2011 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, legislation was approved that called for [[racial segregation|racially segregated]] schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;jimcrowala&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.classroomhelp.com/till/jimcrowlaws/jimcrowalabama.html |title=Jim Crow Laws in Alabama |website=Emmett Till, It All Began with a Whistle |publisher=Classroomhelp |access-date=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891.&lt;ref name=&quot;jimcrowala&quot;/&gt;

The new 1901 Constitution of Alabama included provisions for [[voter registration]] that effectively [[Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] large portions of the population, including nearly all African Americans and Native Americans, and tens of thousands of poor European Americans, through making voter registration difficult, requiring a [[Poll taxes in the United States|poll tax]] and [[literacy test]].&lt;ref&gt;Morgan Kousser. ''The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; The 1901 constitution required racial segregation of public schools. By 1903 only 2,980 African Americans were registered in Alabama, although at least 74,000 were [[Literacy|literate]]. This compared to more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote in 1900. The numbers dropped even more in later decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;/&gt; The state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the 1950s: jails were segregated in 1911; hospitals in 1915; toilets, hotels, and restaurants in 1928; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;jimcrowala&quot;/&gt;

While the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting, the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well, due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;/&gt; By 1941, whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws: 600,000 whites vs. 520,000 African-Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;&gt;Glenn Feldman. ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama''. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all Blacks had lost the ability to vote. Despite numerous legal challenges which succeeded in overturning certain provisions, the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement. The exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1248 |title=Segregation (Jim Crow) |website=Encyclopedia of Alabama|access-date=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised African Americans, but it did not relieve them of paying taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://southernspaces.org/2004/black-belt |title= The Black Belt |access-date =September 23, 2006 |date= April 19, 2004 |journal= Southern Spaces |publisher= Emory University|doi= 10.18737/M70K6P |last1= Tullos |first1= Allen|doi-access= free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South, the [[Rosenwald Fund]] began funding the construction of what came to be known as [[Rosenwald School]]s. In Alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds, which paid one-third of the construction costs. The fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest. Black residents effectively taxed themselves twice, by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools, which were built in many rural areas. They often donated land and labor as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosenwaldal&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The Rosenwald School Building Fund and Associated Buildings MPS |website=National Register Information System |url={{NRHP url|id=64500011}} |access-date=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued racial discrimination and [[lynching]]s, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to [[boll weevil]] infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans from rural Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] out of the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hine |first1=Darlene |last2=Hine |first2=William |last3=Harrold |first3=Stanley |title=African Americans: A Concise History |date=2012 |publisher=Pearson Education, Inc. |location=Boston |isbn=9780205806270 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/africanamericans0000hine_i0f5/page/388 388–389] |edition=4th |url=https://archive.org/details/africanamericans0000hine_i0f5/page/388}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Migration |title=Great Migration {{!}} African-American history|work=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting this emigration, the population growth rate in Alabama (see &quot;historical populations&quot; table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920.&lt;ref name= &quot;census data&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Resident Population Data |url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php |title=Resident Population Data—2010 Census |publisher=2010.census.gov |access-date=January 31, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519131122/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php |archive-date=May 19, 2011 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Beginning in the 1940s, when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters, the Alabama legislature took several counter-steps designed to disfranchise black voters. The legislature passed, and the voters ratified [as these were mostly white voters], a state constitutional amendment that gave local registrars greater latitude to disqualify voter registration applicants. Black citizens in Mobile successfully challenged this amendment as a violation of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]]. The legislature also changed the boundaries of [[Tuskegee, Alabama|Tuskegee]] to a 28-sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits. The Supreme Court unanimously held that this racial &quot;[[gerrymandering]]&quot; violated the Constitution. In 1961,{{nbs}}... the Alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;vra&quot;&gt;James Blacksher, Edward Still, Nick Quinton, Cullen Brown and Royal Dumas.

Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;/&gt; Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living.

Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population, as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses. They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. One result was that [[Jefferson County, Alabama|Jefferson County]], containing Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services. Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature. A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, &quot;a minority of about 25% of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017192719/http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |archive-date=October 17, 2007 |title=George Mason University, United States Election Project: Alabama Redistricting Summary.

In the United States Supreme Court cases of ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1962) and ''[[Reynolds v.

In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census. This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than sixty years.&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot; /&gt; Other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts.

African Americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement, including legal challenges. In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' that public schools had to be [[Desegregation in the United States|desegregated]], but Alabama was slow to comply.

Alabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation. In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, ''[[Dillard v. Crenshaw County]]'', challenged the [[at-large]] voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards. At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;vra&quot; /&gt;

As part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cities and counties, including [[Chilton County, Alabama|Chilton County]], adopted a system of [[proportional representation|cumulative voting]] for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions. This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use [[limited voting]], as in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]]. In 1982, limited voting was first tested in Conecuh County. Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;cum&quot;&gt;[http://archive.fairvote.org/?page=516 &quot;Cumulative Elections in Alabama (2004)&quot;/&quot;Proportional Voting in Alabama&quot;], FairVote Archives, accessed January 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1960s, the state's economy shifted away from its traditional lumber, steel, and textile industries because of increased foreign competition. Steel jobs, for instance, declined from 46,314 in 1950 to 14,185 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bridges |first1=Edwin |title=Alabama: The Making of an American State |date=2016 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |location=Tuscaloosa, AL |page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the state, particularly Huntsville, benefited from the opening of the [[Marshall Space Flight Center|George C. Marshall Space Flight Center]] in 1960, a major facility in the development of the Saturn rocket program and the space shuttle. Technology and manufacturing industries, such as automobile assembly, replaced some the state's older industries in the late twentieth century, but the state's economy and growth lagged behind other states in the area, such as Georgia and Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bridges |first1=Edwin |title=Alabama: The Making of an American State |date=2016 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |location=Tuscaloosa, AL |pages=224–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Alabama Supreme Court chief justice [[Roy Moore]] installed a statue of the [[Ten Commandments]] in the capitol in Montgomery. In 2002, the 11th US Circuit Court ordered the statue removed, but Moore refused to follow the court order, which led to protests around the capitol in favor of keeping the monument.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Alabama}}

The state is classified as [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] (''Cfa'') under the [[Köppen climate classification|Koppen Climate Classification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1283 |title=Encyclopedia of Alabama: Climate |date=August 17, 2007 |publisher=University of Alabama |access-date=April 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621180731/http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1283 |archive-date=June 21, 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average annual temperature is 64{{nbs}}°F (18{{nbs}}°C). Temperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, while the northern parts of the state, especially in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] in the northeast, tend to be slightly cooler.&lt;ref name=&quot;cprgsw&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-78303/Alabama |title=Alabama Climate |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, Alabama has very hot summers and mild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year. Alabama receives an average of {{convert|56|in|mm}} of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300 days in the southern part of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;cprgsw&quot;/&gt;

Summers in Alabama are among the hottest in the U.S., with high temperatures averaging over {{convert|90|°F}} throughout the summer in some parts of the state. Alabama is also prone to [[Tropical cyclone|tropical storms and hurricanes]]. Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken.

South Alabama reports many [[thunderstorm]]s. The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported. This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60 days per year. Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent [[lightning]] and large [[hail]]; the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm. Alabama ranks ninth in the number of deaths from lightning and tenth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/stats/04-13state_fatality_rates.pdf Lightning Fatalities, Injuries and Damages in the United States, 2004–2013] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427010029/http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/stats/04-13state_fatality_rates.pdf |date=April 27, 2014}}.

Alabama, along with [[Oklahoma]] and [[Iowa]], has the most confirmed [[Fujita scale|F5]] and [[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF5]] tornadoes of any state, according to statistics from the [[National Climatic Data Center]] for the period January 1, 1950, to June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsnet5.com/weather/weather-news/kshb-list-states-with-the-most-ef5-tornadoes LIST: States with the most F5/EF5 tornadoes since 1950; Ohio high on list] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426232719/http://www.newsnet5.com/weather/weather-news/kshb-list-states-with-the-most-ef5-tornadoes |date=April 26, 2014}}. Retrieved April 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Several long-tracked F5/EF5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities since 1950 than any other state. The state was affected by the [[1974 Super Outbreak]] and was devastated tremendously by the 2011 Super Outbreak. The 2011 Super Outbreak produced a record amount of tornadoes in the state. The tally reached 62.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Oliver |first=Mike |title=April 27's record tally: 62 tornadoes in Alabama |date=August 4, 2011 |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2011/08/april_27s_record_tally_62_torn.html |publisher=al.com |access-date=November 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state. Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December besides the typically severe spring. The northern part—along the Tennessee River Valley—is most vulnerable. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as [[Dixie Alley]], as distinct from the [[Tornado Alley]] of the Southern Plains.

Winters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the Southeastern United States, with average January low temperatures around {{convert|40|°F}} in Mobile and around {{convert|32|°F}} in Birmingham. Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama, areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years. Historic snowfall events include [[New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm]] and the [[1993 Storm of the Century]]. The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is {{convert|2|in|mm}} per year. In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall.

Alabama's highest temperature of {{convert|112|°F}} was recorded on September 5, 1925, in the unincorporated community of [[Centerville, Alabama|Centerville]]. The record low of {{convert|-27|°F}} occurred on January 30, 1966, in [[New Market, Alabama|New Market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accuracyproject.org/recordtemps.html |title=Record high and low temperatures for all 50 states |website=Internet Accuracy Project |publisher=accuracyproject.org |access-date=November 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scots-Irish were the largest non-English immigrant group from the British Isles before the American Revolution, and many settled in the South, later moving into the Deep South as it was developed.&lt;ref&gt;David Hackett Fischer, Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America, New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp.361–368&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, under the Davis–Strong Act, the state legislature established the [[Alabama Indian Affairs Commission]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aiac&quot;&gt;[http://www.aiac.state.al.us/tribes.aspx &quot;Alabama Indian Affairs Commission&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003045646/http://www.aiac.state.al.us/tribes.aspx |date=October 3, 2013}}, State of Alabama, accessed September 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Native American groups within the state had increasingly been demanding recognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination. Given the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation, the Native American peoples, who have sometimes been of mixed race, have insisted on having their cultural identification respected. In the past, their self-identification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black. The state has [[State-recognized tribes in the United States|officially recognized]] nine American Indian tribes in the state, descended mostly from the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] of the American Southeast. These are the following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aiac.alabama.gov/ByLaws.aspx |title=AIAC Bylaws |website=Alabama Indian Affairs Commission |publisher=State of Alabama |access-date=September 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918101025/http://aiac.alabama.gov/ByLaws.aspx |archive-date=September 18, 2012 |df= mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
Most Alabama residents (95.1% of those five and older) spoke only English at home in 2010, a minor decrease from 96.1% in 2000. Alabama English is predominantly [[Southern American English|Southern]],&lt;ref name=&quot;city-data.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.city-data.com/states/Alabama-Languages.html |title=Alabama—Languages |website=city-data.com |access-date=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is related to South Midland speech which was taken across the border from Tennessee. In the major Southern speech region, there is the decreasing loss of the final ''r'', for example the &quot;boyd&quot; pronunciation of &quot;bird&quot;. In the northern third of the state, there is a South Midland &quot;arm&quot; and &quot;barb&quot; rhyming with &quot;form&quot; and &quot;orb&quot;. Unique words in Alabama English include: redworm ([[earthworm]]), peckerwood ([[woodpecker]]), snake doctor and snake feeder ([[dragonfly]]), tow sack ([[Gunny sack|burlap bag]]), plum peach ([[Clingstone peach|clingstone]]), French harp (harmonica), and dog irons ([[andiron]]s).&lt;ref name=&quot;city-data.com&quot;/&gt;

Alabama is located in the middle of the [[Bible Belt]], a region of numerous Protestant Christians. Alabama has been identified as one of the most religious states in the United States, with about 58% of the population attending church regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060502/news_lz1n2thelist.html |title=Church or synagogue attendance by state |website=The San Diego Union-Tribune |access-date=July 21, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513103435/http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060502/news_lz1n2thelist.html |archive-date=May 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of people in the state identify as Evangelical Protestant. {{as of|2010}}, the three largest denominational groups in Alabama are the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], [[The United Methodist Church]], and [[Nondenominational Christianity|non-denominational]] Evangelical Protestant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/01/rcms2010_01_state_name_2010.asp |publisher=The Association of Religion Data Archives |title=State membership Report |access-date=November 7, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012074403/http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/01/rcms2010_01_state_name_2010.asp |archive-date=October 12, 2013 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Alabama, the Southern Baptist Convention has the highest number of adherents with 1,380,121; this is followed by the United Methodist Church with 327,734 adherents, non-denominational Evangelical Protestant with 220,938 adherents, and the Catholic Church with 150,647 adherents. Many Baptist and Methodist congregations became established in the [[Great Awakening]] of the early 19th century, when preachers proselytized across the South. The [[Assemblies of God]] had almost 60,000 members, the [[Churches of Christ]] had nearly 120,000 members.

The state has invested in aerospace, education, health care, banking, and various heavy industries, including automobile manufacturing, mineral extraction, steel production and [[Metal fabrication|fabrication]].

==Law and government==
===State government===
{{Main|Government of Alabama}}
[[File:Alabama Capitol Building.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama State Capitol|State Capitol Building]] in Montgomery, completed in 1851]]

The foundational document for Alabama's government is the Alabama Constitution, which was ratified in 1901. With over 850 amendments and almost 87,000 words, it is by some accounts the world's longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Lockette, [http://www.annistonstar.com/article_c928bd51-fbf1-5056-a30c-1bf4b19eb012.html?mode=jqm Is the Alabama Constitution the longest constitution in the world?Truth Rating: 4 out of 5], ''Anniston Star''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell Robertson, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/31/us/alabama-simmers-before-vote-on-its-constitutions-racist-language.html Alabama Simmers Before Vote on Its Constitution's Racist Language], ''New York Times'', October 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington Post&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A16443-2004Nov27 |last=Roig-Franzia |first=Manuel |title=Alabama Vote Opens Old Racial Wounds |work=The Washington Post |date=November 28, 2004 |access-date=September 22, 2006}}{{dead link|date=June 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Constitution&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislature.state.al.us/CodeOfAlabama/Constitution/1901/Constitution1901_toc.htm |title=Constitution of Alabama—1901 |website=The Alabama Legislative Information System |access-date=September 22, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923081542/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/CodeOfAlabama/Constitution/1901/Constitution1901_toc.htm |archive-date=September 23, 2006 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama's constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitutionalreform.org/ |title=Alabama Citizens for Constitutional Reform |publisher=Constitutionalreform.org |access-date=October 24, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915165938/http://www.constitutionalreform.org/ |archive-date=September 15, 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argue that Alabama's constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature, leaving practically no power in local hands. Most counties do not have home rule. Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.

[[File:Ala Supreme Court Building Feb 2012 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]] in Montgomery. It houses the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]], [[Alabama Court of Civil Appeals]], and [[Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals]].]]
Alabama's government is divided into three coequal branches. The [[Legislature|legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] currently holds a majority in both houses of the Legislature. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).

Until 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In ''Reynolds v. Sims'' (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court implemented the principle of &quot;one man, one vote&quot;, ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.

At that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding. Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments.

[[File:Portrait-Governor-Kay-Ivey.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Kay Ivey]] is the [[governor of Alabama]] as of 2021.]]
The [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the [[List of governors of Alabama|governor of Alabama]]. Other members of the executive branch include the cabinet, the [[List of lieutenant governors of Alabama|lieutenant governor of Alabama]], the [[Attorney General of Alabama]], the [[Secretary of State of Alabama|Alabama Secretary of State]], the [[Alabama State Treasurer]], and the [[State Auditor of Alabama]]. The current governor is Republican [[Kay Ivey]].

The members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections. Statewide officials, such as the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and other constitutional officers, take office the following January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislature.state.al.us/misc/legislativeprocess/legislativeprocess_ml.html |title=Alabama's Legislative Process |first=McDowell |last=Lee |year=2009 |publisher=State of Alabama |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102162559/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/misc/legislativeprocess/legislativeprocess_ml.html |archive-date=January 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Judiciary|judicial branch]] is responsible for interpreting the state's Constitution and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The [[State supreme court|state's highest court]] is the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]. Alabama uses partisan elections to select judges. Since the 1980s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized.&lt;ref name=&quot;AJS&quot;&gt;[http://www.judicialselection.us/judicial_selection/index.cfm?state=AL Judicial Selection in the States: Alabama] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006162358/http://www.judicialselection.us/judicial_selection/index.cfm?state=AL |date=October 6, 2014}}, American Judicature Society.&lt;/ref&gt; The current [[chief justice]] of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican [[Tom Parker (judge)|Tom Parker]]. All sitting justices on the Alabama Supreme Court are members of the Republican Party. There are two intermediate [[appellate court]]s, the Court of Civil Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals, and four [[trial court]]s: the circuit court (trial court of general jurisdiction), and the district, probate, and municipal courts.&lt;ref name=&quot;AJS&quot;/&gt;

Since Alabama's tax structure largely depends on consumer spending, it is subject to high variable budget structure. For example, in 2003, Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $670{{nbs}}million.

===County and local governments===
{{See also|List of counties in Alabama}}
{{Alabama County Labelled Map|align=right|width=300}}

Alabama has 67 [[county (United States)|counties]]. Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. It also has limited executive authority in the county. Because of the constraints of the Alabama Constitution, which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited [[home rule]]. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning.

The state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;home&quot;/&gt; Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in ''Baker v. Carr'' (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, to implement the principle of &quot;one man, one vote&quot;. Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas.

&quot;The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. Alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;home&quot;&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1153#sthash.CMEMRNbK.dpuf Albert P. Brewer, &quot;Home Rule&quot;], ''Encyclopedia of Alabama'', 2007, accessed February 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama is an [[alcoholic beverage control state]], meaning the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol. The [[Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board]] controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state. A total of 25 of the 67 counties are &quot;[[Dry county|dry counties]]&quot; which ban the sale of alcohol, and there are many dry municipalities in counties which permit alcohol sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcboard.alabama.gov/%28S%28s1j4zjl5nddpfshvrhppmpsb%29%29/wet_dry_map.aspx Wet-Dry Map] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009231316/http://abcboard.alabama.gov/(S(s1j4zjl5nddpfshvrhppmpsb))/wet_dry_map.aspx |date=October 9, 2016}}, Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
During Reconstruction following the American Civil War, Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the [[Third Military District]] under [[John Pope (military officer)|General John Pope]]. In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud, and intimidation.

After 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.

From 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation.

Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement, when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Governor George Wallace, the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. Only after passage of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964&lt;ref name=&quot;cra64&quot;/&gt; and Voting Rights Act of 1965 did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by at-large electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish [[Single-member district|single-member districts]] that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.

In 2007, the Alabama Legislature passed, and Republican governor [[Bob Riley]] signed a resolution expressing &quot;profound regret&quot; over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[Alabama State Capitol]], which housed Congress of the Confederate States of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Phillip |last=Rawls |title=Alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=The Virginian Pilot |date=June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/11/gop_takes_alabama_legislature.html |title=GOP takes control of Alabama Legislature after 136 years |last=White |first=David|date=November 2, 2010|work=[[The Birmingham News]] |access-date=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2021|May|}}, there are a total of 3,589,839 registered voters, with 3,518,285 active, and the others inactive in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data |title=Elections Data Downloads |publisher=Alabama Secretary of State |access-date=May 27, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elections===

====State elections====
With the disfranchisement of Blacks in 1901, the state became part of the &quot;[[Solid South]]&quot;, a system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state. For nearly a hundred years local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]], with generally only token [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] challengers running in the General Election. Since the mid- to late 20th century, however, white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party. In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office.

Members of the nine seats on the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |title=Sue Bell Cobb considering running for governor |website=The Birmingham News |date=May 2, 2009 |access-date=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. In that general election, the then-incumbent chief justice, [[Ernest C. Hornsby]], refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican [[Perry Hooper Sr.|Perry O. Hooper Sr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2016-04-26|title=Chief Justice Perry Hooper remembered as GOP pioneer|url=https://www.al.com/news/2016/04/alabama_chief_justice_perry_ho.html|access-date=2021-04-02|website=al}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}} The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.

In the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the [[Alabama State Board of Education]]. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission, was defeated in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |title=Commissioners |publisher=Psc.state.al.us |access-date=August 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718210525/http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |archive-date=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Special |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |title=Lucy Baxley wins Alabama Public Service Commission presidency, but recount possible |publisher=Birmingham News via al.com |date=November 5, 2008 |access-date=August 7, 2009 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090802212747/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |archive-date=August 2, 2009 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Amy |url=http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |title=Public Service Commission: Twinkle Cavanaugh, Terry Dunn join GOP sweep |publisher=al.com |access-date=June 1, 2011 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120306232802/http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |archive-date=March 6, 2012 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only three Republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise. The three GOP lieutenant governors are [[Steve Windom]] (1999–2003), [[Kay Ivey]] (2011–2017), and [[Will Ainsworth]] (2019–present).

====Local elections====
Many local offices (county commissioners, boards of education, tax assessors, tax collectors, etc.) in the state are still held by Democrats. Many rural counties have voters who are majority Democrats, resulting in local elections being decided in the Democratic primary. Similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority-Republican and elections are effectively decided in the Republican Primary, although there are exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=1&amp;year=2006&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=1 |title=2006 Gubernatorial Democratic Primary Election Results—Alabama |publisher=Uselectionatlas.org |access-date=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=1&amp;year=2006&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=2 |title=2006 Gubernatorial Republican Primary Election Results—Alabama |publisher=Uselectionatlas.org |date=February 15, 2007 |access-date=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama's 67 county sheriffs are elected in partisan, at-large races, and Democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts. The current split is 35 [[Alabama Democratic Party|Democrats]], 31 [[Alabama Republican Party|Republicans]], and one Independent Fayette.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alabamasheriffs.com/pages?id=41 |title=Alabama Sheriffs 2015–2019 |website=www.alabamasheriffs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties. The majority of Republican sheriffs have been elected in the more urban/suburban and heavily populated counties. {{as of|2015}}, the state of Alabama has one female sheriff, in [[Morgan County, Alabama]], and ten African-American sheriffs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASA&quot;/&gt;

====Federal elections====
The state's two [[United States Senate|U.S. senators]] are Republican [[Richard Shelby|Richard C. Shelby]] and Republican [[Tommy Tuberville]]. Shelby was originally elected to the Senate as a Democrat in 1986 and re-elected in 1992, but switched parties immediately following the November 1994 general election.

In the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are Republicans: ([[Bradley Byrne]], [[Mike D. Rogers]], [[Robert Aderholt]], [[Morris J. Brooks]], [[Martha Roby]], and [[Gary Palmer (politician)|Gary Palmer]]) and one Democrat: [[Terri Sewell]] who represents the Black Belt as well as most of the predominantly black portions of Birmingham, Tuscaloosa and Montgomery.

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Alabama}}

===Primary and secondary education===
[[File:Vestavia Hills High School.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vestavia Hills High School]] in the suburbs of Birmingham]]

Public primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the purview of the Alabama State Board of Education as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. Together, 1,496 individual schools provide education for 744,637 elementary and secondary students.&lt;ref name=&quot;qfacts&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alsde.edu/sec/comm/Pages/quickfacts-item.aspx?FilterField1=ID&amp;FilterValue1=7 |title=Alabama Education Quick Facts 2012–13 |access-date=April 29, 2014 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund. In FY 2006–2007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year. In 2007, more than 82 percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National [[No Child Left Behind Act|No Child Left Behind]] law, using measures determined by the state of Alabama.

While Alabama's public education system has improved in recent decades, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states. According to U.S. Census data (2000), Alabama's high school graduation rate (75%) is the fourth lowest in the U.S. (after [[Kentucky]], [[Louisiana]] and Mississippi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-24.pdf |title=Educational Attainment : 2000 : Census 2000 Brief |website=Census.gov |access-date=December 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusscope.org/us/s1/chart_education.html Education Statistics]. CensusScope.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally prohibited in the West at large, [[school corporal punishment]] is not unusual in Alabama, with 27,260 public school students [[paddle (spanking)|paddled]] at least one time, according to government data for the 2011–2012 school year.&lt;ref&gt;This figure refers to only the number of students paddled, and does not refer to the number of instances of corporal punishment, which would be higher.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CORPUN_US_SCHOOL&quot; /&gt; The rate of school corporal punishment in Alabama is surpassed by only Mississippi and Arkansas.&lt;ref name=&quot;CORPUN_US_SCHOOL&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corpun.com/counuss.htm |title= Corporal punishment in US schools |publisher=[[World Corporal Punishment Research]] |last = Farrell |first = Colin | date=February 2016 |access-date=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harrison-plaza2.jpg|thumb|left|Harrison Plaza at the [[University of North Alabama]] in Florence. The school was chartered as LaGrange College by the [[Alabama Legislature]] in 1830.]]

Alabama's programs of higher education include 14 four-year public universities, two-year community colleges, and 17 private, undergraduate and graduate universities.

===Aviation===
{{Main|Aviation in Alabama}}

Major airports with sustained operations in Alabama include [[Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport]] (BHM), [[Huntsville International Airport]] (HSV), [[Dothan Regional Airport]] (DHN), [[Mobile Regional Airport]] (MOB), [[Montgomery Regional Airport]] (MGM), [[Northwest Alabama Regional Airport]]&lt;!--no longer Muscle Shoals Aux--&gt; (MSL) and [[Northeast Alabama Regional Airport]] (GAD).

===Rail===
For rail transport, [[Amtrak]] schedules the ''[[Crescent (train)|Crescent]]'', a daily passenger train, running from New York to New Orleans with station stops at [[Anniston station|Anniston]], [[Birmingham station (Alabama)|Birmingham]], and [[Tuscaloosa station|Tuscaloosa]].

===Roads===
Alabama has six major interstate routes: [[Interstate 65 in Alabama|Interstate 65]] (I-65) travels north–south roughly through the middle of the state; [[Interstate 20 in Alabama|I-20]]/[[Interstate 59 in Alabama|I-59]] travel from the central west Mississippi state line to Birmingham, where I-59 continues to the north-east corner of the state and I-20 continues east towards [[Atlanta]]; [[Interstate 85 in Alabama|I-85]] originates in Montgomery and travels east-northeast to the Georgia state line, providing a main thoroughfare to Atlanta; and [[Interstate 10 in Alabama|I-10]] traverses the southernmost portion of the state, traveling from west to east through Mobile. [[Interstate 22 in Alabama|I-22]] enters the state from Mississippi and connects Birmingham with [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. In addition, there are currently five auxiliary interstate routes in the state: [[Interstate 165 (Alabama)|I-165]] in Mobile, [[Interstate 359|I-359]] in Tuscaloosa, [[Interstate 459|I-459]] around Birmingham, [[Interstate 565|I-565]] in Decatur and Huntsville, and [[Interstate 759|I-759]] in Gadsden. A sixth route, [[Interstate 685|I-685]], will be formed when I-85 is rerouted along a new southern bypass of Montgomery. A proposed northern bypass of Birmingham will be designated as [[Interstate 422|I-422]]. Since a direct connection from I-22 to I-422 will not be possible, [[Interstate 222|I-222]] has been proposed, as well.

Several U.S. Highways also pass through the state, such as [[U.S. Route 11 in Alabama|U.S. Route 11]] (US-11), [[U.S. Route 29 in Alabama|US-29]], [[U.S. Route 31 in Alabama|US-31]], [[U.S. Route 43 in Alabama|US-43]], [[U.S. Route 45 in Alabama|US-45]], [[U.S. Route 72 in Alabama|US-72]], [[U.S. Route 78 in Alabama|US-78]], [[U.S. Route 80 in Alabama|US-80]], [[U.S. Route 82 in Alabama|US-82]], [[U.S. Route 84 in Alabama|US-84]], [[U.S. Route 90 in Alabama|US-90]], [[U.S. Route 98 in Alabama|US-98]], [[U.S. Route 231 in Alabama|US-231]], [[U.S. Route 278 in Alabama|US-278]], [[U.S. Route 280 in Alabama|US-280]], [[U.S. Route 331 in Alabama|US-331]], [[U.S. Route 411 in Alabama|US-411]], and [[U.S. Route 431 in Alabama|US-431]].

There are four toll roads in the state: Montgomery Expressway in Montgomery; Northport/Tuscaloosa Western Bypass in Tuscaloosa and [[Northport, Alabama|Northport]]; Emerald Mountain Expressway in Wetumpka; and Beach Express in [[Orange Beach, Alabama|Orange Beach]].

===Ports===
The [[Port of Mobile]], Alabama's only saltwater port, is a large seaport on the Gulf of Mexico with inland waterway access to the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] by way of the [[Tennessee–Tombigbee Waterway]]. The Port of Mobile was ranked 12th by tons of traffic in the United States during 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;tonstraffic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Table 1086.

{{Greek myth}}

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Achilles''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|ɪ|l|iː|z}} {{respell|ə|KIL|eez}}; {{IPA-la|äˈkʰɪlːʲeːs̠|lang}}) or '''Achilleus''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀχιλλεύς|Akhilleús}}, {{IPA-grc|a.kʰil.lěu̯s|}}) was a hero of the [[Trojan War]], the greatest of all the Greek warriors, and is the central character of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''. He was the son of the [[Nereid]] [[Thetis]] and [[Peleus]], king of [[Phthia]].

Achilles' most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan prince [[Hector]] outside the gates of [[Troy]]. Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the ''Iliad'', other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], who shot him with an arrow. Later legends (beginning with [[Statius]]' unfinished epic ''[[Achilleid]]'', written in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for one heel, because when his mother [[Thetis]] dipped him in the river [[Styx]] as an infant, she held him by one of his heels. Alluding to these legends, the term &quot;[[Achilles' heel]]&quot; has come to mean a point of weakness, especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution. The [[Achilles tendon]] is also named after him due to these legends.

Achilles' name can be analyzed as a combination of {{lang|grc|ἄχος}} (''{{transl|grc|áchos}}'') &quot;distress, pain, sorrow, grief&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Scholia to the ''Iliad'', 1.1.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|grc|λαός}} (''{{transl|grc|laós}}'') &quot;people, soldiers, nation&quot;, resulting in a proto-form ''*Akhí-lāu̯os'' &quot;he who has the people distressed&quot; or &quot;he whose people have distress&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leonard Palmer|title=The Interpretation of Mycenaean Greek Texts|place=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1963|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nagy&gt;{{cite web|author=Gregory Nagy|title=The best of the Achaeans|url=http://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5442|website=CHS|publisher=The Center for Hellenic Studies, Harvard University|access-date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grief or distress of the people is a theme raised numerous times in the ''Iliad'' (and frequently by Achilles himself). Achilles' role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of {{lang|grc|κλέος}} ''{{transl|grc|kléos}}'' (&quot;glory&quot;, usually in war). Furthermore, ''laós'' has been construed by [[Gregory Nagy]], following [[Leonard Palmer]], to mean &quot;a corps of soldiers&quot;, a [[muster (military)|muster]].&lt;ref name=Nagy/&gt; With this derivation, the name obtains a double meaning in the poem: when the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring distress to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.

[[File:The Education of Achilles 1862 Delacroix.jpg|thumb|right|''The Education of Achilles'', by [[Eugène Delacroix]], pastel on paper, c.&amp;nbsp;1862 ([[Getty Center]], Los Angeles)]]

Another etymology relates the name to a [[Proto-Indo-European]] [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] ''*h₂eḱ-pṓds'' &quot;sharp foot&quot; which first gave an [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]] ''*āk̂pediós'', evolving through time into ''*ākhpdeós'' and then ''*akhiddeús''. The shift from ''-dd-'' to ''-ll-'' is then ascribed to the passing of the name into Greek via a [[Pre-Greek]] source. The first root part ''*h₂eḱ-'' &quot;sharp, pointed&quot; also gave Greek ἀκή (''akḗ'' &quot;point, silence, healing&quot;), ἀκμή (''akmḗ'' &quot;point, edge, zenith&quot;) and ὀξύς (''oxús'' &quot;sharp, pointed, keen, quick, clever&quot;), whereas ἄχος stems from the root ''*h₂egʰ-'' &quot;to be upset, afraid&quot;. The whole expression would be comparable to the [[Latin]] ''acupedius'' &quot;swift of foot&quot;. Compare also the Latin word family of ''aciēs'' &quot;sharp edge or point, battle line, battle, engagement&quot;, ''acus'' &quot;needle, pin, bodkin&quot;, and ''acuō'' &quot;to make pointed, sharpen, whet; to exercise; to arouse&quot; (whence ''acute'').&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the Wiktionary entries [[wikt:Ἀχιλλεύς|&quot;Ἀχιλλεύς&quot;]] and [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h₂eḱ-|''*h₂eḱ-'']].&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Literary topos|topical]] [[epitheta]] of Achilles in the ''Iliad'' point to this &quot;swift-footedness&quot;, namely ποδάρκης δῖος Ἀχιλλεὺς (''podárkēs dĩos Achilleús'' &quot;swift-footed divine Achilles&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 1.121, 2.688.&lt;/ref&gt; or, even more frequently, πόδας ὠκὺς Ἀχιλλεύς (''pódas ōkús Achilleús'' &quot;quick-footed Achilles&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;E. g. ''Iliad'' 1.58, 1.84, 1.148, 1.215, 1.364, 1.489.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers deem the name a [[loan word]], possibly from a [[Pre-Greek]] language.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Pauly&quot;/&gt; Achilles' descent from the [[Nereid]] [[Thetis]] and a similarity of his name with those of [[Potamoi|river deities]] such as [[Acheron]] and [[Achelous]] have led to speculations about his being an old [[Greek sea gods|water divinity]] (see below [[#Worship|Worship]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the supportive position of {{cite journal|author=Hildebrecht Hommel|title=Der Gott Achilleus|journal=Sitzungsberichte der Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften|issue=1|year=1980|pages=38–44}}&amp;nbsp;– A critical point of view is taken by {{cite journal|author=J. T. Hooker|title=The cults of Achilleus|journal=Rheinisches Museum für Philologie|volume=131|issue=3|date=1988|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert S. P. Beekes]] has suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] origin of the name, based among other things on the coexistence of ''-λλ-'' and ''-λ-'' in epic language, which may account for a palatalized phoneme /l&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;/ in the original language.&lt;ref name=Beekes&gt;Robert S. P. Beekes, ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, pp. 183ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Birth and early years ==

[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 181.jpg|thumb|''Thetis Dipping the Infant Achilles into the River Styx'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1625; [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]], Rotterdam)]]
Achilles was the son of the [[Thetis]], a [[nereid]], and [[Peleus]], the king of the [[Myrmidons]]. [[Zeus]] and [[Poseidon]] had been rivals for Thetis's hand in marriage until [[Prometheus]], the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy (originally uttered by [[Themis]], goddess of divine law) that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed Peleus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschylus]], ''Prometheus Bound'' 755–768; [[Pindar]], ''Nemean'' 5.34–37, ''Isthmian'' 8.26–47; Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 3.13.5; ''[[Poeticon astronomicon]]'' 2.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: In the ''[[Argonautica]]'' (4.760) Zeus' sister and wife [[Hera]] alludes to Thetis' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus, pointing out that Thetis was so loyal to Hera's marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods. Thetis, although a daughter of the sea-god [[Nereus]], was also brought up by Hera, further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus. Zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 3.13.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Achilleus Lyra.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chiron]] teaching Achilles how to play the [[lyre]], Roman [[fresco]] from [[Herculaneum]], 1st century AD]]

According to the ''[[Achilleid]]'', written by [[Statius]] in the 1st century AD, and to [[Lost works|non-surviving previous sources]], when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river [[Styx]]; however, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him: his left heel&lt;ref&gt;Statius, ''Achilleid'' 1.269; Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Jonathan S. Burgess| title = The Death and Afterlife of Achilles| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ko_YAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA9| access-date = 5 February 2010| year = 2009| publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press| location = Baltimore| isbn = 978-0-8018-9029-1| page = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Achilles' heel]], [[Achilles' tendon]]). It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier. In another version of this story, Thetis anointed the boy in [[ambrosia]] and put him on top of a fire in order to burn away the mortal parts of his body. She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''[[Argonautica]]'' 4.869–879.&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the sources before Statius make any reference to this general invulnerability. To the contrary, in the ''Iliad'', Homer mentions Achilles being wounded: in Book 21 the [[Paeonian]] hero [[Asteropaeus]], son of [[Pelagon]], challenged Achilles by the river [[Scamander]]. He was ambidextrous, and cast a spear from each hand; one grazed Achilles' elbow, &quot;drawing a spurt of blood&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Homer (Robert Fagles translation) |title=The Iliad |page=525 |quote=But the other (spear) grazed Achilles' strong right arm and dark blood gushed as the spear shot past his back}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Education of Achilles, by James Barry.jpg|thumb|''The Education of Achilles'' (c. 1772), by [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]] ([[Yale Center for British Art]])]]
In the few fragmentary poems of the [[Epic Cycle]] which describe the hero's death (i.e. the ''[[Cypria]]'', the ''[[Little Iliad]]'' by [[Lesches]] of Pyrrha, the ''[[Aithiopis]]'' and ''[[Iliou persis]]'' by [[Arctinus of Miletus]]), there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel. In the later vase paintings presenting the death of Achilles, the arrow (or in many cases, arrows) hit his torso.

Peleus entrusted Achilles to [[Chiron]] the [[Centaur]], who lived on [[Mount Pelion]], to be reared.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''Catalogue of Women'', fr. 204.87–89 MW; ''Iliad'' 11.830–832.&lt;/ref&gt; Thetis foretold that her son's fate was either to gain glory and die young, or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity. Achilles chose the former, and decided to take part in the Trojan War.&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 9.410ff.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Homer, Achilles grew up in Phthia with his companion [[Patroclus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;New Pauly&quot;/&gt;

According to [[Photius]], the sixth book of the ''New History'' by [[Ptolemy Hephaestion]] reported that Thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by Peleus. When she had Achilles, Peleus noticed, tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot, and confided him to the centaur Chiron. Later Chiron exhumed the body of the [[Damysus (Giant)|Damysus]], who was the fastest of all the giants, removed the ankle, and incorporated it into Achilles' burnt foot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/photius_copyright/photius_05bibliotheca.htm Photius, ''Bibliotheca'', cod. 190]: &quot;Thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by Peleus; six were born; when she had Achilles, Peleus noticed and tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot and confided him to Chiron.  The latter exhumed the body of the giant Damysos who was buried at Pallene—Damysos was the fastest of all the giants—removed the 'astragale' and incorporated it into Achilles' foot using 'ingredients'.  This 'astragale' fell when Achilles was pursued by Apollo and it was thus that Achilles, fallen, was killed.  It is said, on the other hand, that he was called Podarkes by the Poet, because, it is said, Thetis gave the newborn child the wings of Arce and Podarkes means that his feet had the wings of Arce.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other names ===
Among the appellations under which Achilles is generally known are the following:&lt;ref&gt; {{Source-attribution|sentence=yes|{{Cite book|title=A Classical Manual: Being a Mythological, Historical and Geographical Commentary on Pope's Homer, and Dryden's Aeneid of Virgil, with a Copious Index|last=Murray|first=John|year=1833|location=Albemarle Street, London|page=3}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Pyrisous''', &quot;saved from the fire&quot;, his first name, which seems to favour the tradition in which his mortal parts were burned by his mother Thetis
* '''Aeacides''', from his grandfather [[Aeacus]]
* '''Aemonius''', from Aemonia, a country which afterwards acquired the name of Thessaly
* '''Aspetos''', &quot;inimitable&quot; or &quot;vast&quot;, his name at [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]]
* '''Larissaeus''', from [[Larissa]] (also called Cremaste), a town of Thessaly, which still bears the same name
* '''Ligyron''', his original name
* '''Nereius''', from his mother Thetis, one of the [[Nereid]]s
* '''Pelides''', from his father, [[Peleus]]
* '''Phthius''', from his birthplace, [[Phthia]]
* '''Podarkes''', “swift-footed”, due to the wings of Arke being attached to his feet.&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemy Hephaestion, New History Book 6 (summary from Photius, Myriobiblon 190) (trans. Pearse) (Greek mythographer C1st to C2nd A.D.) :

&quot;It is said . . . that he [Akhilleus (Achilles)] was called Podarkes (Podarces, Swift-Footed) by the Poet [i.e. Homer], because, it is said, Thetis gave the newborn child the wings of Arke (Arce) and Podarkes means that his feet had the wings of Arke. And Arke was the daughter of Thaumas and her sister was Iris; both had wings, but, during the struggle of the gods against the Titanes (Titans), Arke flew out of the camp of the gods and joined the Titanes. After the victory Zeus removed her wings before throwing her into Tartaros and, when he came to the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, he brought these wings as a gift for Thetis.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hidden on Skyros ===

Some post-Homeric sources&lt;ref&gt;[[Euripides]], ''Skyrioi'', surviving only in fragmentary form; [[Philostratus III|Philostratus Junior]], ''Imagines'' i; Scholiast on Homer's ''Iliad'', 9.326; [[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'' 13.162–180; Ovid, ''[[Tristia]]'' 2.409–412 (mentioning a Roman tragedy on this subject); Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 3.13.8; [[Statius]], ''[[Achilleid]]'' 1.689–880, 2.167ff.&lt;/ref&gt; claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war, Thetis (or, in some versions, Peleus) hid the young man at the court of [[Lycomedes]], king of [[Skyros]].

There, Achilles was disguised as a girl and lived among Lycomedes' daughters, perhaps under the name &quot;[[Pyrrha (mythology)|Pyrrha]]&quot; (the red-haired girl), [[Cercysera]] or [[Aissa (mythology)|Aissa]] (&quot;swift&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=[[Robert Graves|Graves, Robert]]|first=|title=The Greek Myths - The Complete and Definitive Edition|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|year=2017|isbn=9780241983386|pages=Index s.v.

According to this story, Odysseus learned from the prophet [[Calchas]] that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles' aid. Odysseus went to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women's clothes and jewellery and placed a shield and spear among his goods. When Achilles instantly took up the spear, Odysseus saw through his disguise and convinced him to join the Greek campaign. In another version of the story, Odysseus arranged for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes' women. While the women fled in panic, Achilles prepared to defend the court, thus giving his identity away.

== In the Trojan War ==

[[File:Achilles Agamemnon Pompei mosaic NAMNaples 10006.jpg|thumb|Achilles and [[Agamemnon]], from a [[mosaic]] from [[Pompeii]], 1st century AD]]

According to the ''Iliad'', Achilles arrived at Troy with 50 ships, each carrying 50 [[Myrmidons]]. He appointed five leaders (each leader commanding 500 Myrmidons): Menesthius, [[Eudoros|Eudorus]], Peisander, [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoenix]] and Alcimedon.&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 16.168–197.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telephus ===
When the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in [[Mysia]], ruled by King [[Telephus]]. In the resulting battle, Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that &quot;he that wounded shall heal&quot;. Guided by the oracle, he arrived at [[Argos, Peloponnese|Argos]], where Achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Epitome 3.20&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pseudo-Apollodorus|title=Bibliotheca, Epitome 3.20|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/ApollodorusE.html#69|website=theoi.com|ref=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to other reports in [[Euripides]]' [[lost works|lost play]] about Telephus, he went to [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]] pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound. Achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge. Alternatively, Telephus held [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]] for ransom, the ransom being Achilles' aid in healing the wound. [[Odysseus]] reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore, the spear must be able to heal it. Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Epitome 3.20&quot;/&gt;

=== Troilus ===

[[File:Achilles slaying Troilus.PNG|thumb|left|Achilles slaying Troilus, red-figure kylix signed by [[Euphronios]]]]

According to the ''[[Cypria]]'' (the part of the [[Epic Cycle]] that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles' wrath), when the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] desired to return home, they were restrained by Achilles, who afterwards attacked the cattle of [[Aeneas]], sacked neighbouring cities (like [[Pedasus]] and [[Lyrnessus]], where the Greeks capture the queen [[Briseis]]) and killed [[Tenes]], a son of [[Apollo]], as well as Priam's son [[Troilus]] in the sanctuary of [[Apollo]] [[Thymbra]]ios; however, the romance between Troilus and [[Chryseis]] described in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' and in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' is a medieval invention.&lt;ref name=&quot;stoa.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stoa.org/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Stoa:text:2003.01.0004 |title=Proclus' Summary of the Cypria |publisher=Stoa.org |access-date=9 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009120320/http://www.stoa.org/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Stoa:text:2003.01.0004 |archive-date=9 October 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;New Pauly&quot;/&gt;

=== In the ''Iliad'' ===
{{main|Iliad}}

[[File:Wall painting - Briseis taken away from Achilles - Pompeii (VI 8 5) - Napoli MAN 9105 - 01.jpg|thumb|Achilles cedes [[Briseis]] to [[Agamemnon]], from the [[House of the Tragic Poet]] in [[Pompeii]], fresco, 1st century AD ([[Naples National Archaeological Museum]])]]

Homer's ''Iliad'' is the most famous narrative of Achilles' deeds in the Trojan War. Achilles' wrath (μῆνις Ἀχιλλέως, ''mênis Achilléōs'') is the central theme of the poem. The first two lines of the ''Iliad'' read:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|Μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληιάδεω Ἀχιλῆος&lt;br&gt;
οὐλομένην, ἣ μυρί' Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε' ἔθηκε, [...]
|Sing, Goddess, of the rage of Peleus' son Achilles,&lt;br&gt;
the accursed rage that brought great suffering to the Achaeans, [...]
|}

The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the decade-long war, and does not narrate Achilles' death. It begins with Achilles' withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by [[Agamemnon]], the commander of the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]] forces. Agamemnon has taken a woman named [[Chryseis]] as his slave. Her father [[Chryses]], a priest of [[Apollo]], begs Agamemnon to return her to him. Agamemnon refuses, and Apollo sends a plague amongst the Greeks. The prophet [[Calchas]] correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless Achilles vows to protect him. Achilles does so, and Calchas declares that Chryseis must be returned to her father. Agamemnon consents, but then commands that Achilles' battle prize [[Briseis]], the daughter of [[Briseus]], be brought to him to replace Chryseis. Angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away (and, as he says later, because he loves Briseis),&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 9.334–343.&lt;/ref&gt; with the urging of his mother Thetis, Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces. At the same time, burning with rage over Agamemnon's theft, Achilles [[Homeric prayer|prays]] to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war, so that he may regain his honour.

As the battle turns against the Greeks, thanks to the influence of Zeus, [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] declares that the Trojans are winning because Agamemnon has angered Achilles, and urges the king to appease the warrior. Agamemnon agrees and sends [[Odysseus]] and two other chieftains, [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] and [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoenix]]. They promise that, if Achilles returns to battle, Agamemnon will return the captive Briseis and other gifts. Achilles rejects all Agamemnon offers him and simply urges the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do.

The Trojans, led by [[Hector]], subsequently push the Greek army back toward the beaches and assault the Greek ships. With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction, [[Patroclus]] leads the [[Myrmidons]] into battle, wearing Achilles' armour, though Achilles remains at his camp. Patroclus succeeds in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches, but is killed by Hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of Troy.

After receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from [[Antilochus]], the son of Nestor, Achilles grieves over his beloved companion's death. His mother Thetis comes to comfort the distraught Achilles. She persuades [[Hephaestus]] to make new armour for him, in place of the armour that Patroclus had been wearing, which was taken by Hector. The new armour includes the [[Shield of Achilles]], described in great detail in the poem.

Enraged over the death of Patroclus, Achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field, killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector. Achilles even engages in battle with the river god [[Scamander]], who has become angry that Achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed. The god tries to drown Achilles but is stopped by [[Hera]] and Hephaestus. Zeus himself takes note of Achilles' rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack Troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles can defy fate itself. Finally, Achilles finds his prey. Achilles chases Hector around the wall of Troy three times before [[Athena]], in the form of Hector's favorite and dearest brother, [[Deiphobus]], persuades Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face. After Hector realizes the trick, he knows the battle is inevitable. Wanting to go down fighting, he charges at Achilles with his only weapon, his sword, but misses. Accepting his fate, Hector begs Achilles not to spare his life, but to treat his body with respect after killing him. Achilles tells Hector it is hopeless to expect that of him, declaring that &quot;my rage, my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw – such agonies you have caused me&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Iliad&quot;, Fagles translation. Penguin Books, 1991: 22.346.&lt;/ref&gt; Achilles then kills Hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot. After having a dream where Patroclus begs Achilles to hold his funeral, Achilles hosts a series of funeral games in honour of his companion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lattimore |first1=Richmond |title=The Illiad of Homer |date=2011 |publisher=The University of Chicago |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-46937-9 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/iliad00home_5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the onset of his duel with Hector, Achilles is referred to as the brightest star in the sky, which comes on in the autumn, Orion's dog ([[Sirius]]); a sign of evil. During the cremation of Patroclus, he is compared to [[Hesperus]], the evening/western star ([[Venus]]), while the burning of the funeral pyre lasts until [[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]], the morning/eastern star (also Venus) has set (descended).

With the assistance of the god [[Hermes]] (Argeiphontes), Hector's father [[Priam]] goes to Achilles' tent to plead with Achilles for the return of Hector's body so that he can be buried. Achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral, lasting 9 days with a burial on the 10th (in the tradition of [[Niobe]]'s offspring). The poem ends with a description of Hector's funeral, with the doom of Troy and Achilles himself still to come.

=== Later epic accounts: fighting Penthesilea and Memnon ===

[[File:Akhilleus Memnon Staatliche Antikensammlungen 1410.jpg|thumb|Achilles and Memnon fighting, between Thetis and Eos, Attic black-figure amphora, c. 510 BC, from Vulci]]

The ''[[Aethiopis]]'' (7th century BC) and a work named ''[[Posthomerica]]'', composed by [[Quintus of Smyrna]] in the fourth century CE, relate further events from the [[Trojan War]]. When [[Penthesilea]], queen of the [[Amazons]] and daughter of [[Ares]], arrives in Troy, Priam hopes that she will defeat Achilles. After his temporary truce with Priam, Achilles fights and kills the warrior queen, only to grieve over her death later.&lt;ref&gt;[[Propertius]], 3.11.15; [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] 1.&lt;/ref&gt; At first, he was so distracted by her beauty, he did not fight as intensely as usual. Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life, he refocused and killed her.&lt;!--- Sources for this? &quot;Achilles fought and killed the [[Amazons|Amazon]] [[Helene (Amazon)|Helene]].&quot; --&gt;

Following the death of Patroclus, Nestor's son [[Antilochus]] becomes Achilles' closest companion. When [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], son of the Dawn Goddess [[Eos]] and king of [[Ethiopia (mythology)|Ethiopia]], slays Antilochus, Achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield, killing Memnon. Consequently, Eos will not let the sun rise until Zeus persuades her. The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess.

Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the ''Iliad''{{'}}s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles' reaction to it. The episode then formed the basis of the [[Epic Cycle|cyclic epic]] ''[[Aethiopis]]'', which was composed after the ''Iliad'', possibly in the 7th century BC. The ''Aethiopis'' is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors.

=== Achilles and Patroclus ===
{{main|Achilles and Patroclus}}

[[File:Akhilleus Patroklos Antikensammlung Berlin F2278.jpg|thumb|Achilles tending Patroclus wounded by an arrow, Attic red-figure [[kylix]], c. 500 BC ([[Altes Museum]], Berlin)]]

The exact nature of Achilles' relationship with Patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times. In the ''Iliad'', it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship. Homer does not suggest that Achilles and his close friend Patroclus had sexual relations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= The Tribal Imagination: Civilization and the Savage Mind |author= Robin Fox |year= 2011 |publisher= Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674060944 |quote= There is certainly no evidence in the text of the Iliad that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers.|page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=YCxy_4Bt1F0C&amp;pg=PA223 223]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Alexander the Great: The Story of an Ancient Life|last= Martin |first= Thomas R |year= 2012 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 978-0521148443 |quote= The ancient sources do not report, however, what modern scholars have asserted: that Alexander and his very close friend Hephaestion were lovers. Achilles and his equally close friend Patroclus provided the legendary model for this friendship, but Homer in the ''Iliad'' never suggested that they had sex with each other. (That came from later authors.)|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no direct evidence in the text of the ''Iliad'' that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers, this theory was expressed by some later authors. Commentators from [[classical antiquity]] to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures. In 5th-century BCE Athens, the intense bond was often viewed in light of the [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|Greek custom of ''paiderasteia'']]. In Plato's ''Symposium'', the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple; Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Sym.+180a 180a]; the beauty of Achilles was a topic already broached at ''Iliad'' 2.673–674.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ancient Greek had no words to distinguish [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexual]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Dover]], ''Greek Homosexuality'' (Harvard University Press, 1978, 1989), p. 1 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women. Many pairs of men throughout history have been compared to Achilles and Patroclus to imply a homosexual relationship.

=== Death ===
{{anchor|Fatalwound}}
[[File:Closeup of Achilles thniskon in Corfu Achilleion autocorrected.JPG|thumb|left|''Dying Achilles'' (Achilleas thniskon) in the gardens of the Achilleion]]
The death of Achilles, even if considered solely as it occurred in the oldest sources, is a complex one, with many different versions.&lt;ref&gt;Abrantes 2016: c. 4.3.1&lt;/ref&gt; In the oldest version, the ''Iliad'', and as predicted by [[Hector]] with his dying breath, the hero's death was brought about by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] with an arrow (to the heel according to Statius). In some versions, the god [[Apollo]] guided Paris' arrow. Some retellings also state that Achilles was scaling the gates of Troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow. All of these versions deny Paris any sort of valour, owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was, and Achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield.

[[File:Aias body Akhilleus Staatliche Antikensammlungen 1884.jpg|thumb|right|Ajax carries off the body of Achilles, [[Attica|Attic]] black-figure [[lekythos]] from Sicily (c. 510 BC – [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]], Munich)]]
After death, Achilles' bones were mingled with those of [[Patroclus]], and funeral games were held. He was represented in the ''Aethiopis'' as living after his death in the island of [[Leuke]] at the mouth of the river [[Danube]].
Another version of Achilles' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses, [[Polyxena]]. Achilles asks Priam for Polyxena's hand in marriage. Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world's greatest warrior. But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles, Paris, who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister, hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow, killing him.

In the ''Odyssey'', Agamemnon informs Achilles of his pompous burial and the erection of his [[mound]] at the [[Hellespont]] while they are receiving the dead [[Suitors of Penelope|suitors]] in Hades.&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'' 24.36–94.&lt;/ref&gt; He claims they built a massive burial mound on the beach of Ilion that could be seen by anyone approaching from the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Odyssey of Homer| author= Richmond Lattimore| publisher = Harper Perennial| year = 2007| isbn = 978-0-06-124418-6| location = New York| page = 347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of Patroclus.&lt;ref&gt;E. Hamilton (1969), ''Mythology''. New York: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Paris was later killed by [[Philoctetes]] using the enormous bow of [[Heracles]].

In Book 11 of Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as &quot;blessed in life, blessed in death&quot;, responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead. But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son's exploits in the Trojan war, and when Odysseus tells of Neoptolemus' heroic actions, Achilles is filled with satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'' 11.467–564.&lt;/ref&gt; This leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how Achilles felt about the heroic life.

According to some accounts, he had married [[Medea]] in life, so that after both their deaths they were united in the [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]] of [[Hades]]&amp;nbsp;– as Hera promised Thetis in [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius]]' ''[[Argonautica]]'' (3rd century BC).

=== Fate of Achilles' armour ===
[[File:Odysseus Ajax Louvre F340.jpg|thumb|left|Oinochoe, ''ca'' 520 BC, [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] and [[Odysseus]] fighting over the armour of Achilles]]
Achilles' armour was the object of a feud between [[Odysseus]] and [[Ajax the Great|Telamonian Ajax]] (Ajax the greater). They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners, who, after considering both men's presentations, decided Odysseus was more deserving of the armour. Furious, Ajax cursed Odysseus, which earned him the ire of Athena, who temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep, thinking them his comrades. After a while, when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep, he was so ashamed that he committed suicide. Odysseus eventually gave the armour to [[Neoptolemus]], the son of Achilles. When Odysseus encounters the shade of Ajax much later in the House of Hades (''Odyssey'' 11.543–566), Ajax is still so angry about the outcome of the competition that he refuses to speak to Odysseus.

A relic claimed to be Achilles' bronze-headed spear was preserved for centuries in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of [[Phaselis]], Lycia, a port on the Pamphylian Gulf. The city was visited in 333 BCE by [[Alexander the Great]], who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the ''Iliad'' with him, but his court biographers do not mention the spear; however, it was shown in the time of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] in the 2nd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Alexander came to rest at Phaselis, a coastal city which was later renowned for the possession of Achilles' original spear.&quot; Robin Lane Fox, ''Alexander the Great'', 1973, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, iii.3.6; see Christian Jacob and Anne Mullen-Hohl, &quot;The Greek Traveler's Areas of Knowledge: Myths and Other Discourses in Pausanias' Description of Greece&quot;, ''Yale French Studies'' '''59''': ''Rethinking History: Time, Myth, and Writing'' (1980:65–85, especially 81).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Achilles, Ajax and a game of ''petteia'' ===

Numerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions. At some point in the war, Achilles and [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] were playing a [[board game]] (''petteia'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.psu.edu/wxk116/roma/petteia.html &quot;Petteia&quot;.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209122834/http://www.personal.psu.edu/wxk116/roma/petteia.html |date=9 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Austin/index.html &quot;Greek Board Games&quot;.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408090534/http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Austin/index.html |date=8 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/w/x/wxk116/roma/latruncu.html &quot;Latrunculi&quot;.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060915044905/http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/w/x/wxk116/roma/latruncu.html |date=15 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trojans attacked and reached the heroes, who were saved only by an intervention of Athena.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ioannis Kakridis]] (1988).

The spread and intensity of the hero's veneration among the [[Greeks in pre-Roman Crimea|Greeks]] that had [[Second Greek colonisation|settled]] on the northern coast of the [[Pontus Euxinus]], today's Black Sea, appears to have been remarkable. An archaic cult is attested for the [[Miletus|Milesian]] colony of [[Olbia (archaeological site)|Olbia]] as well as for an island in the middle of the Black Sea, today identified with [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|Snake Island]] ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] Зміїний, ''Zmiinyi'', near [[Kiliya]], [[Ukraine]]). Early dedicatory inscriptions from the [[Greek colonies]] on the [[Black Sea]] ([[graffiti]] and inscribed clay disks, these possibly being [[votive offering]]s, from Olbia, the area of [[Berezan Island]] and the [[Tauric Chersonese]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hildebrecht Hommel|title=Der Gott Achilleus|journal=Sitzungsberichte der Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften|issue=1|year=1980|pages=38–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;) attest the existence of a [[heroic cult]] of Achilles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. T. Hooker|title=The cults of Achilleus|journal=Rheinisches Museum für Philologie|volume=131|issue=3|date=1988|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the sixth century BC onwards. The cult was still thriving in the third century CE, when dedicatory [[stelae]] from Olbia refer to an ''Achilles Pontárchēs'' (Ποντάρχης, roughly &quot;lord of the Sea,&quot; or &quot;of the [[Pontus Euxinus]]&quot;), who was invoked as a protector of the city of Olbia, venerated on par with [[Olympian gods]] such as the local [[Apollo]] Prostates, [[Hermes]] Agoraeus,&lt;ref name=Hedreen/&gt; or [[Poseidon]].&lt;ref&gt;Quintus Smyrnaeus, 3.770–779.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]] (23–79 AD) in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' mentions a &quot;port of the Achæi&quot; and an &quot;island of Achilles&quot;, famous for the tomb of that &quot;man&quot; ({{lang|la|portus Achaeorum, insula Achillis, tumulo eius viri clara}}), situated somewhat nearby Olbia and the [[Dnieper-Bug Estuary]]; furthermore, at 125&amp;nbsp;[[Roman mile]]s from this island, he places a peninsula &quot;which stretches forth in the shape of a sword&quot; obliquely, called ''Dromos Achilleos'' (Ἀχιλλέως δρόμος, ''Achilléōs drómos'' &quot;[[Racecourse of Achilles|the Race-course of Achilles]]&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Naturalis Historia'' 4.12.83 ([https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D26#note-link10 chapter 4.26]).&lt;/ref&gt; and considered the place of the hero's exercise or of games instituted by him.&lt;ref name=Hedreen/&gt; This last feature of Pliny's account is considered to be the iconic [[Spit (landform)|spit]], called today ''Tendra'' (or ''Kosa Tendra'' and ''Kosa Djarilgatch''), situated between the mouth of the [[Dnieper]] and [[Karkinit Bay]], but which is hardly 125&amp;nbsp;[[Roman mile]]s (c. 185&amp;nbsp;km) away from the [[Dnieper-Bug estuary]], as Pliny states. (To the &quot;Race-course&quot; he gives a length of 80&amp;nbsp;miles, c.&amp;nbsp;120&amp;nbsp;km, whereas the spit measures c.&amp;nbsp;70&amp;nbsp;km today.)

In the following chapter of his book, Pliny refers to the same island as ''Achillea'' and introduces two further names for it: ''Leuce'' or ''Macaron'' (from Greek [νῆσος] μακαρῶν &quot;island of the blest&quot;). The &quot;present day&quot; measures, he gives at this point, seem to account for an identification of ''Achillea'' or ''Leuce'' with today's Snake Island.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Naturalis Historia'' 4.13.93 ([https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D27 chapter 4.27]): &quot;Researches which have been made at the present day place this island at a distance of 140 miles from the Borysthenes, of 120 from [[Tyras]], and of fifty from the island of [[Peuce Island|Peuce]]. It is about ten miles in circumference.&quot; Though afterwards he speaks again of &quot;the remaining islands in the Gulf of [[Kerkinitis|Carcinites]]&quot; which are &quot;Cephalonesos, Rhosphodusa [or Spodusa], and Macra&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's contemporary [[Pomponius Mela]] (c. 43 AD) tells that Achilles was buried on an island named ''Achillea'', situated between the [[Borysthenes]] and the [[Danube|Ister]], adding to the geographical confusion.&lt;ref&gt;Pomponius Mela, ''De situ orbis'' 2.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruins of a square temple, measuring 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to Achilles, were discovered by Captain Kritzikly in 1823 on Snake Island. A second exploration in 1840 showed that the construction of a lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple. A fifth century BC [[Black-glazed Ware|black-glazed]] [[lekythos]] inscription, found on the island in 1840, reads: &quot;Glaukos, son of Poseidon, dedicated me to Achilles, lord of Leuke.&quot; In another inscription from the fifth or fourth century BC, a statue is dedicated to Achilles, lord of Leuke, by a citizen of Olbia, while in a further dedication, the city of Olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the island's cult, again suggesting its quality as a place of a supra-regional hero veneration.&lt;ref name=Hedreen/&gt;

The heroic cult dedicated to Achilles on ''Leuce'' seems to go back to an account from the lost epic ''[[Aethiopis]]'' according to which, after his untimely death, Thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical {{lang|el|Λεύκη Νῆσος}} (''Leúkē Nêsos'' &quot;White Island&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[[Proclus]], ''Chrestomathia'' 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Already in the fifth century BC, [[Pindar]] had mentioned a cult of Achilles on a &quot;bright island&quot; (φαεννά νᾶσος, ''phaenná nâsos'') of the Black Sea,&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, ''Nemea'' 4.49ff.; Arrian, ''[[Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]'' 21.&lt;/ref&gt; while in another of his works, Pindar would retell the story of the immortalized Achilles living on a geographically indefinite [[Island of the Blest]] together with other heroes such as his father [[Peleus]] and [[Cadmus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, ''Olympia'' 2.78ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Well known is the connection of these mythological [[Fortunate Isles]] (μακαρῶν νῆσοι, ''makárôn nêsoi'') or the Homeric [[Elysium]] with the stream [[Oceanus]] which according to Greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world, which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the Euxine with it.&lt;ref name=Hedreen/&gt; Guy Hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of Achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]], speaking of &quot;Achilles lord of Scythia&quot;&lt;ref&gt;D. Page, ''Lyrica Graeca Selecta'', Oxford 1968, p. 89, no. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; and the opposition of North and South, as evoked by Achilles' fight against the [[Aethiopia]]n prince [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother [[Eos]] after his death.

The ''[[Periplus Ponti Euxini|Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]'' (c. 130 AD) gives the following details:

{{quote|It is said that the goddess Thetis raised this island from the sea, for her son Achilles, who dwells there. Here is his temple and his statue, an archaic work. This island is not inhabited, and goats graze on it, not many, which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships, sacrifice to Achilles. In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts, craters, rings and precious stones, offered to Achilles in gratitude. One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin, in which Achilles is praised and celebrated. Some of these are worded in Patroclus' honour, because those who wish to be favored by Achilles, honour Patroclus at the same time. There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds, which look after Achilles' temple. Every morning they fly out to sea, wet their wings with water, and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it. And after they finish the sprinkling, they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings. Other people say still more, that some of the men who reach this island, come here intentionally. They bring animals in their ships, destined to be sacrificed. Some of these animals they slaughter, others they set free on the island, in Achilles' honour. But there are others, who are forced to come to this island by sea storms. As they have no sacrificial animals, but wish to get them from the god of the island himself, they consult Achilles' oracle. They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island, and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair. But in case the oracle denies them permission, because there is an oracle here, they add something to the price offered, and if the oracle refuses again, they add something more, until at last, the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient. And then the victim doesn't run away any more, but waits willingly to be caught. So, there is a great quantity of silver there, consecrated to the hero, as price for the sacrificial victims. To some of the people who come to this island, Achilles appears in dreams, to others he would appear even during their navigation, if they were not too far away, and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Densuşianu&quot;/&gt;}}

The Greek geographer [[Dionysius Periegetes]], who likely lived during the first century CE, wrote that the island was called ''Leuce'' &quot;because the wild animals which live there are white. It is said that there, in Leuce island, reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius Periegetes, ''Orbis descriptio'' 5.541, quoted in Densuşianu 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, others relate the island's name to its white cliffs, snakes or birds dwelling there.&lt;ref name=Hedreen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''[[Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]'' 21; Scholion to Pindar, ''Nemea'' 4.79.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] has been told that the island is &quot;covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame. In this island there is also Achilles' temple and his statue&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 3.19.11.&lt;/ref&gt; Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. Pausanias reports that the [[Delphi]]c [[Pythia]] sent a lord of [[Crotone|Croton]] to be cured of a chest wound.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 3.19.13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] attributes the healing to waters (''aquae'') on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' 22.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters were dedicated to Achilles. [[Herodotus]], [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Strabo]] reported on the existence of a town ''Achílleion'' (Ἀχίλλειον), built by settlers from [[Mytilene]] in the sixth century BC, close to the hero's presumed burial mound in the [[Troad]].&lt;ref name=Troad/&gt; Later attestations point to an ''Achílleion'' in [[Messenia]] (according to [[Stephanus Byzantinus]]) and an ''Achílleios'' (Ἀχίλλειος) in [[Laconia]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 3.25.4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicolae Densuşianu]] recognized a connection to Achilles in the names of [[Aquileia]] and of the northern arm of the Danube delta, called [[Chilia Veche|Chilia]] (presumably from an older ''Achileii''), though his conclusion, that Leuce had sovereign rights over the Black Sea, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law.&lt;ref name=&quot;Densuşianu&quot;&gt;Nicolae Densuşianu: ''Dacia preistorică''. Bucharest: Carol Göbl, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

The kings of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son, [[Neoptolemus]]. [[Alexander the Great]], son of the Epirote princess [[Olympias]], could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor. He is said to have visited the tomb of Achilles at [[Achilleion (Troad)#Tomb of Achilles|Achilleion]] while passing Troy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arrian]], ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'' 1.12.1, [[Cicero]], ''Pro Archia Poeta'' 24.&lt;/ref&gt; In AD 216 the Roman Emperor [[Caracalla]], while on his way to war against [[Parthia]], emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles' tumulus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dio Cassius]] 78.16.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception during antiquity ==
=== In Greek tragedy ===
{{main|Achilleis (trilogy)}}
The [[tragedy|Greek tragedian]] [[Aeschylus]] wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title ''Achilleis'' by modern scholars. The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War, including his defeat of [[Hector]] and eventual death when an arrow shot by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and guided by [[Apollo]] punctures his heel. Extant fragments of the ''Achilleis'' and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play. The first part of the ''Achilleis'' trilogy, ''The Myrmidons'', focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus, who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon; only a few lines survive today.&lt;ref&gt;Pantelis Michelakis, ''Achilles in Greek Tragedy'', 2002, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In Plato's ''Symposium'', Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved; Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because Achilles, being the younger and more beautiful of the two, was the beloved, who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to avenge him.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Symposium'', translated Benjamin Jowett, Dover Thrift Editions, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The tragedian [[Sophocles]] also wrote ''The Lovers of Achilles'', a play with Achilles as the main character. Only a few fragments survive.&lt;ref&gt;S. Radt. ''Tragicorum Graecorum fragmenta'', vol. 4, (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1977) frr. 149–157a.&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the 5th century BCE, a more negative view of Achilles emerges in Greek drama; [[Euripides]] refers to Achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in ''[[Hecuba (play)|Hecuba]]'', ''[[Electra (Euripides)|Electra]]'', and ''[[Iphigenia in Aulis]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Latacz 2010&quot;&gt;Latacz 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Greek philosophy ===
====Zeno====
The philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]] centred one of [[Zeno's paradoxes|his paradoxes]] on an imaginary footrace between &quot;[[Epithets in Homer#Individuals|swift-footed]]&quot; [[Achilles and the tortoise|Achilles and a tortoise]], by which he attempted to show that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start, and therefore that motion and change were impossible. As a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the Eleatic school, Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions.

====Plato====
In ''[[Hippias Minor]]'', a dialogue attributed to [[Plato]], an arrogant man named Hippias argues with [[Socrates]]. The two get into a discussion about lying. They decide that a person who is intentionally false must be &quot;better&quot; than a person who is unintentionally false, on the basis that someone who lies intentionally must understand the subject about which they are lying. Socrates uses various analogies, discussing athletics and the sciences to prove his point.&lt;ref name=&quot;hm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jowett |first1=Benjamin |author2=Plato |title=Lesser Hippias |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1673/1673-h/1673-h.htm |publisher=Project Gutenberg |date=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two also reference Homer extensively. Socrates and Hippias agree that [[Odysseus]], who concocted a number of lies throughout the ''Odyssey'' and other stories in the Trojan War Cycle, was false intentionally. Achilles, like Odysseus, told numerous falsehoods. Hippias believes that Achilles was a generally honest man, while Socrates believes that Achilles lied for his own benefit. The two argue over whether it's better to lie on purpose or by accident. Socrates eventually abandons Homeric arguments and makes sports analogies to drive home the point: someone who does wrong on purpose is a better person than someone who does wrong unintentionally.&lt;ref name=&quot;hm&quot;/&gt;

=== In Roman and medieval literature ===
The Romans, who traditionally traced their lineage to Troy, took a highly negative view of Achilles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Latacz 2010&quot;/&gt; [[Virgil]] refers to Achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men,&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 2.28, 1.30, 3.87.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Horace]] portrays Achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children.&lt;ref&gt;''Odes'' 4.6.17–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers, such as [[Catullus]], [[Propertius]], and [[Ovid]], represent a second strand of disparagement, with an emphasis on Achilles' erotic career. This strand continues in Latin accounts of the Trojan War by writers such as [[Dictys Cretensis]] and [[Dares Phrygius]] and in [[Benoît de Sainte-Maure]]'s ''[[Roman de Troie]]'' and [[Guido delle Colonne]]'s ''[[Historia destructionis Troiae]]'', which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the [[Matter of Troy]] until the 17th century.

Achilles was described by the Byzantine chronicler [[Leo the Deacon]], not as [[Hellenes|Hellene]], but as [[Scythians|Scythian]], while according to the Byzantine author [[John Malalas]], his army was made up of a tribe previously known as Myrmidons and later as [[Bulgars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ekonomou|first1=Andrew|title=Byzantine Rome and the Greek Popes|date=2007|publisher=Lexington Books|location=UK|page=123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zomZk6DbFTIC&amp;q=john+malalas+myrmidons+achilles&amp;pg=PA123|access-date=14 September 2015|isbn=9780739119778}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Croke|first2=Brian|title=Studies in John Malalas|location=Australian Association for Byzantine Studies, Department of Modern Greek, University of Sydney|page=206|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p55mAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=john+malalas+myrmidons+achilles|access-date=14 September 2015|isbn=9780959362657|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It became famous for its part in the [[Battle of the River Plate]], alongside {{HMS|Ajax|22|6}} and {{HMS|Exeter|68|6}}. In addition to earning the battle honour 'River Plate', HMNZS ''Achilles'' also served at Guadalcanal 1942–1943 and Okinawa in 1945. After returning to the Royal Navy, the ship was sold to the [[Indian Navy]] in 1948, but when she was scrapped parts of the ship were saved and preserved in New Zealand.

'''Abraham Lincoln''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|ŋ|k|ən}}; February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was an American lawyer and statesman who served as the 16th [[president of the United States]] from 1861 until [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|his assassination]] in 1865. Lincoln led the nation through the [[American Civil War]] and succeeded in preserving the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolishing]] [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], bolstering the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], and modernizing the [[U.S. economy]].

Lincoln was born into poverty in a log cabin and was raised on the [[American frontier|frontier]] primarily in [[Indiana]]. He was self-educated and became a lawyer, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] leader, [[Illinois]] state [[Illinois House of Representatives|legislator]], and U.S. Congressman [[List of United States Representatives from Illinois|from Illinois]]. In 1849, he returned to his law practice but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to slavery as a result of the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]]. He reentered politics in 1854, becoming a leader in the new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and he reached a national audience in the [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|1858 debates]] against [[Stephen Douglas]]. Lincoln ran for President [[1860 United States presidential election|in 1860]], sweeping the [[Northern United States|North]] in victory. Pro-slavery elements in the [[Southern United States|South]] equated his success with the North's rejection of their right to practice slavery, and southern states began [[Secession|seceding from the Union]]. To secure its independence, the new [[Confederate States]] [[Battle of Fort Sumter|fired on Fort Sumter]], a U.S. fort in the South, and Lincoln called up forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union.

Lincoln, a moderate Republican, had to navigate a contentious array of factions with friends and opponents from both the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and Republican parties. His allies, the [[War Democrat]]s and the [[Radical Republicans]], demanded harsh treatment of the Southern Confederates. Anti-war Democrats (called &quot;[[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]]&quot;) despised Lincoln, and irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements plotted his assassination. He managed the factions by exploiting their mutual enmity, carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people. His [[Gettysburg Address]] appealed to [[nationalistic]], [[Republicanism|republican]], [[egalitarian]], [[libertarian]], and [[Democracy|democratic]] sentiments. Lincoln scrutinized the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals and the [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of the South's trade. He suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'' in [[Maryland]], and he averted British intervention by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. He engineered the end to slavery with his [[Emancipation Proclamation]], including his order that the Army and Navy liberate, protect, and recruit former slaves. He also encouraged [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and promoted the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which outlawed slavery across the country.

Lincoln managed his own successful [[1864 United States presidential election|re-election campaign]]. He sought to heal the war-torn nation through reconciliation. On April 14, 1865, just days after the war's end at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]], he was attending a play at [[Ford's Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], with his wife [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary]] when he was fatally shot by Confederate sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]]. Lincoln is remembered as a [[martyr]] and hero of the United States and is consistently [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States#Scholar survey summary|ranked]] as one of the greatest presidents in American history.

==Family and childhood==
===Early life===
{{Main|Early life and career of Abraham Lincoln}}
Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, the second child of [[Thomas Lincoln]] and [[Nancy Lincoln|Nancy Hanks Lincoln]], in a log cabin on [[Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park|Sinking Spring Farm]] near [[Hodgenville, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=20–22}} He was a descendant of [[Samuel Lincoln]], an Englishman who migrated from [[Hingham, Norfolk]], to its namesake, [[Hingham, Massachusetts]], in 1638. The family then migrated west, passing through [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Virginia]].{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=3–4}} Lincoln's paternal grandparents, his namesake [[Abraham Lincoln (captain)|Captain Abraham Lincoln]] and wife Bathsheba (née Herring) moved the family from Virginia to [[Jefferson County, Kentucky]].{{efn|The identity of Lincoln’s grandmother Bathsheba Herring, though without certainty, is the consensus of multiple Lincoln biographers.{{sfn|Harrison|1935|p=276}}}} The captain was killed in an [[Northwest Indian War|Indian raid]] in 1786.{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=4}} His children, including eight-year-old Thomas, Abraham's father, witnessed the attack.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=21}}{{efn|Thomas, born January 1778, would have been 8 at the attack, May 1786. Older sources use six.{{sfn|Wilson|Davis|Wilson|Herndon|1998|pp=35-36}}}} Thomas then worked at odd jobs in Kentucky and [[Tennessee]] before the family settled in [[Hardin County, Kentucky]], in the early 1800s.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=21}}

The [[Nancy Hanks Lincoln heritage|heritage of Lincoln's mother Nancy]] remains unclear, but it is widely assumed that she was the daughter of Lucy Hanks.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|p=79}} Thomas and Nancy married on June 12, 1806, in Washington County, and moved to [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=9}} They had three children: [[Sarah Lincoln Grigsby|Sarah]], Abraham, and Thomas, who died as infant.{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=9–10}}

Thomas Lincoln bought or leased farms in Kentucky before losing all but {{convert|200|acre|ha}} of his land in court disputes over [[Title (property)|property titles]].{{sfn|Sandburg|1926|p=20}} In 1816, the family moved to [[Indiana]] where the land surveys and titles were more reliable.{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=13}} Indiana was a [[Slave states and free states|&quot;free&quot; (non-slaveholding)]] territory, and they settled in an &quot;unbroken forest&quot;{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=26}} in Hurricane Township, [[History of Perry County, Indiana|Perry County, Indiana]].{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=16, 43}}{{efn|Their land eventually became part of Space, when the county was established in 1818.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=3, 5, 16}}}} In 1860, Lincoln noted that the family's move to Indiana was &quot;partly on account of slavery&quot;, but mainly due to land title difficulties.{{sfnm|Sandburg|1926|1p=20|Donald|1996|2pp=23–24}}
[[File:Log Cabin at the Lincoln Living Historical Farm.jpg|thumb|right|The farm site where Lincoln grew up in [[Spencer County, Indiana]]]]
In Kentucky and Indiana, Thomas worked as a farmer, cabinetmaker, and carpenter.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=34, 156}} At various times, he owned farms, livestock, and town lots, paid taxes, sat on juries, appraised estates, and served on county patrols. Thomas and Nancy were members of a [[Separate Baptists]] church, which forbade alcohol, dancing, and slavery.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=22–24}}

Overcoming financial challenges, Thomas in 1827 obtained [[clear title]] to {{convert|80|acre|ha}} in Indiana, an area which became the [[Little Pigeon Creek Community]].{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=24, 104}}

===Mother's death===
On October 5, 1818, Nancy Lincoln succumbed to [[milk sickness]], leaving 11-year-old Sarah in charge of a household including her father, 9-year-old Abraham, and Nancy's 19-year-old orphan cousin, Dennis Hanks.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=22–23, 77}} Ten years later, on January 20, 1828, Sarah died while giving birth to a [[stillborn]] son, devastating Lincoln.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=34, 116}}

On December 2, 1819, Thomas married [[Sarah Bush Lincoln|Sarah Bush Johnston]], a widow from Elizabethtown, Kentucky, with three children of her own.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=23, 83}} Abraham became close to his stepmother and called her &quot;Mother&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=26–27}} Lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with farm life. His family even said he was lazy, for all his &quot;reading, scribbling, writing, ciphering, writing Poetry, etc&quot;.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=25, 31, 47}} His stepmother acknowledged he did not enjoy &quot;physical labor&quot;, but loved to read.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|p=66}}

===Education and move to Illinois===
Lincoln was largely self-educated.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=10, 33}} His formal schooling was from [[itinerant teacher]]s. It included two short stints in Kentucky, where he learned to read but probably not to write, at age seven,{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=23}} and in Indiana, where he went to school sporadically due to farm chores, for a total of less than 12 months in aggregate by the age of 15.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p= 29}} He persisted as an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning.{{sfn|Madison|2014|p=110}} Family, neighbors, and schoolmates recalled that his reading included the [[King James Version|King James Bible]], [[Aesop's Fables]], [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'', [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', and ''[[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin]]''.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=29–31, 38–43}}

As a teen, Lincoln took responsibility for chores and customarily gave his father all earnings from work outside the home until he was 21.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=30–33}} Lincoln was tall, strong, and athletic, and became adept at using an ax.{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=134–135}} He was an active wrestler during his youth and trained in the rough [[Catch wrestling|catch-as-catch-can]] style (also known as catch wrestling). He became county wrestling champion at the age of 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dellinger |first1=Bob |title=Wrestling in the USA |url=https://nwhof.org/stillwater/resources-library/history/wrestling-in-the-usa/ |website=National Wrestling Hall of Fame |access-date=April 9, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gained a reputation for strength and audacity after winning a wrestling match with the renowned leader of ruffians known as &quot;the Clary's Grove Boys&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=41}}

In March 1830, fearing another milk sickness outbreak, several members of the extended Lincoln family, including Abraham, moved west to Illinois, a free state, and settled in [[Macon County, Illinois|Macon County]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=36}}{{efn|Historians disagree on who initiated the move; Thomas Lincoln had no obvious reason to do so. One possibility is that other members of the family, including Dennis Hanks, may not have matched Thomas's stability and steady income.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=38–40}}}} Abraham then became increasingly distant from Thomas, in part due to his father's lack of education.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|p=71}} In 1831, as Thomas and other family prepared to move to a [[Lincoln Log Cabin State Historic Site|new homestead]] in [[Coles County, Illinois]], Abraham struck out on his own.{{sfn|Oates|1974|pp=15–17}} He made his home in [[Lincoln's New Salem|New Salem, Illinois]], for six years.{{sfn|Thomas|2008|pp=23–53}} Lincoln and some friends took goods by [[flatboat]] to [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], where he was first exposed to slavery.{{sfnm|Sandburg|1926|1pp=22–23|Donald|1996|2p=38}}

In 1865, Lincoln was asked how he came to acquire his rhetorical skills. He answered that in the practice of law he frequently came across the word &quot;demonstrate&quot; but had insufficient understanding of the term. So, he left Springfield for his father's home to study until he &quot;could give any proposition in the six books of [[Euclid]] [here, referencing Euclid's [[Euclid's Elements|''Elements'']]] at sight.&quot;{{sfn|Ellenberg|2021}}

Lincoln's first romantic interest was [[Ann Rutledge]], whom he met when he moved to New Salem. By 1835, they were in a relationship but not formally engaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Gannett |first=Lewis |date=Winter 2005 |title=&quot;Overwhelming Evidence&quot; of a Lincoln-Ann Rutledge Romance?: Reexamining Rutledge Family Reminiscences |url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0026.104/--overwhelming-evidence-of-a-lincoln-ann-rutledge-romance?rgn=main;view=fulltext |magazine=Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association |location=Springfield, IL |publisher=The Abraham Lincoln Association |pages=28–41 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403014805/https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0026.104/--overwhelming-evidence-of-a-lincoln-ann-rutledge-romance?rgn=main;view=fulltext |archive-date=April 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She died on August 25, 1835, most likely of [[typhoid fever]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=55–58}} In the early 1830s, he met Mary Owens from Kentucky.{{sfn|Thomas|2008|pp=56–57, 69–70}}

Late in 1836, Lincoln agreed to a match with Owens if she returned to New Salem. Owens arrived that November and he courted her for a time; however, they both had second thoughts. On August 16, 1837, he wrote Owens a letter saying he would not blame her if she ended the relationship, and she never replied.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=67}}

In 1839, Lincoln met [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]] in [[Springfield, Illinois]], and the following year they became engaged.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=80–86}} She was the daughter of [[Robert Smith Todd]], a wealthy lawyer and businessman in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Lamb|Swain|2008|p=3}} A wedding set for January 1, 1841, was canceled at Lincoln's request, but they reconciled and married on November 4, 1842, in the Springfield mansion of Mary's sister.{{sfn|Sandburg|1926|pp=46–51}} While anxiously preparing for the nuptials, he was asked where he was going and replied, &quot;To hell, I suppose.&quot;{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=93}} In 1844, the couple bought [[Lincoln Home National Historic Site|a house]] in Springfield near his law office. Mary kept house with the help of a hired servant and a relative.{{sfn|Baker|1989|p=142}}

Lincoln was an affectionate husband and father of four sons, though his work regularly kept him away from home. The oldest, [[Robert Todd Lincoln]], was born in 1843 and was the only child to live to maturity. [[Edward Baker Lincoln]] (Eddie), born in 1846, died February 1, 1850, probably of tuberculosis. Lincoln's third son, [[William Wallace Lincoln|&quot;Willie&quot; Lincoln]] was born on December 21, 1850, and died of a fever at the [[White House]] on February 20, 1862. The youngest, [[Tad Lincoln|Thomas &quot;Tad&quot; Lincoln]], was born on April 4, 1853, and survived his father but died of heart failure at age 18 on July 16, 1871.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=179–181, 476}}{{efn|The Lincolns' last descendant, great-grandson [[Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith]], died in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Emerson, Jason |title=Giant in the Shadows: The Life of Robert T.

Herndon]] would grow irritated when Lincoln would bring his children to the law office. Their father, it seemed, was often too absorbed in his work to notice his children's behavior. Herndon recounted, &quot;I have felt many and many a time that I wanted to wring their little necks, and yet out of respect for Lincoln I kept my mouth shut. Lincoln did not note what his children were doing or had done.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hertz |first1=Emanuel |title=The Hidden Lincoln |date=1938 |publisher=The Viking Press |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deaths of their sons, Eddie and Willie, had profound effects on both parents. Lincoln suffered from &quot;[[history of depression|melancholy]]&quot;, a condition now thought to be [[major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlanticoct2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200510/lincolns-clinical-depression |title=Lincoln's Great Depression |first=Joshua Wolf |last=Shenk |date=October 2005 |work=The Atlantic |publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009044732/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/10/lincoln-apos-s-great-depression/4247/ |archive-date=October 9, 2011 |url-status=live |access-date=October 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in life, Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons, and Robert committed her for a time to an asylum in 1875.{{sfn|Steers Jr.|2010|p=341}}

==Early career and militia service==
{{Further|Early life and career of Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln in the Black Hawk War}}
In 1832, Lincoln joined with a partner, [[Denton Offutt]], in the purchase of a general store on credit in New Salem.{{sfn|Winkle|2001|pp=72–79}} Although the economy was booming, the business struggled and Lincoln eventually sold his share. That March he entered politics, running for the [[Illinois General Assembly]], advocating navigational improvements on the [[Sangamon River]].

True to his record, Lincoln professed to friends in 1861 to be &quot;an old line Whig, a disciple of Henry Clay&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=222}} Their party favored economic modernization in banking, tariffs to fund [[internal improvements]] including railroads, and urbanization.{{sfn|Boritt|Pinsker|2002|pp=137–153}}

In 1843, Lincoln sought the Whig nomination for [[Illinois's 7th congressional district|Illinois' 7th district seat]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]; he was defeated by [[John J. Hardin]] though he prevailed with the party in limiting Hardin to one term. Lincoln not only pulled off his strategy of gaining the nomination in 1846 but also won the election. He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation, but as dutiful as any participated in almost all votes and made speeches that toed the party line.{{sfn|Oates|1974|p=79}} He was assigned to the [[United States House Committee on Post Office and Post Roads|Committee on Post Office and Post Roads]] and the [[United States House Committee on Expenditures in the War Department|Committee on Expenditures in the War Department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Congressman Lincoln – Abraham Lincoln Historical Society|url=http://www.abraham-lincoln-history.org/us-congressman-lincoln/|publisher=Abraham-lincoln-history.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215191236/http://www.abraham-lincoln-history.org/us-congressman-lincoln/|archive-date=December 15, 2018|access-date=February 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln teamed with [[Joshua R.

He dropped the bill when it eluded Whig support.{{sfnm|Harris|2007|1p=54|Foner|2010|2p=57}}

=== Political views ===
On foreign and military policy, Lincoln spoke against the [[Mexican–American War]], which he imputed to President [[James K. Polk]]'s desire for &quot;military glory—that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood&quot;.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2006|pp=181–183}} He supported the [[Wilmot Proviso]], a failed proposal to ban slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico.{{sfn|Holzer|2004|p=63}}

Lincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his [[Spot Resolutions]]. The war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico, and Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had &quot;invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own soil&quot;.{{sfn|Oates|1974|pp=79–80}} Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil.{{sfn|Graebner|1959|pp=199–202}} The resolution was ignored in both Congress and the national papers, and it cost Lincoln political support in his district.

Lincoln had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the House. Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency, he supported General [[Zachary Taylor]] for the Whig nomination in the [[1848 United States presidential election|1848 presidential election]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=124–126}} Taylor won and Lincoln hoped in vain to be appointed Commissioner of the [[General Land Office]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=140}} The administration offered to appoint him secretary or governor of the [[Oregon Territory]] as consolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnold |first=Isaac Newton |date=1885 |title=The Life of Abraham Lincoln |volume=2 |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=3zgDAAAAYAAJ|page=81}} |location=Chicago, IL |publisher=Janses, McClurg, &amp; Company |page=81 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold, and acceptance of the post would have disrupted his legal and political career in Illinois, so he declined and resumed his law practice.{{sfn|Harris|2007|pp=55–57}}

As a riverboat man, Lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented whoever hired him.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=142–143}} He later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in [[Hurd v.

Lincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases; he was sole counsel in 51 cases, of which 31 were decided in his favor.{{sfn|Richards|2015|p=440}} From 1853 to 1860, one of his largest clients was the [[Illinois Central Railroad]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=155–156, 196–197}} His legal reputation gave rise to the nickname &quot;Honest Abe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5GJ6Un1JA_8C}}|title=The Wisdom of Abraham Lincoln|last=Library|first=Philosophical|date=November 9, 2010|publisher=Open Road Media|isbn=978-1-4532-0281-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln argued in an 1858 criminal trial, defending [[William &quot;Duff&quot; Armstrong]], who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=150–151}} The case is famous for Lincoln's use of a fact established by [[judicial notice]] to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness. After an opposing witness testified to seeing the crime in the moonlight, Lincoln produced a ''[[Farmers' Almanac]]'' showing the moon was at a low angle, drastically reducing visibility. Armstrong was acquitted.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=150–151}}

Leading up to his presidential campaign, Lincoln elevated his profile in an 1859 murder case, with his defense of Simeon Quinn &quot;Peachy&quot; Harrison who was a third cousin;{{efn|Lincoln was a descendant of the [[Harrison family of Virginia]] through his grandmother, Bathsheba Herring.{{sfn|Harrison|1935|pp=280–286, 350–351}}}} Harrison was also the grandson of Lincoln's political opponent, [[Peter Cartwright (revivalist)|Rev.

Lincoln argued that the testimony involved a [[dying declaration]] and was not subject to the hearsay rule. Instead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling and admitted the testimony into evidence, resulting in Harrison's acquittal.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=150–151}}

===Emergence as Republican leader===
{{Further|Slave states and free states|Abraham Lincoln and slavery}}
[[File:Abraham Lincoln by Byers, 1858 - crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Lincoln in 1858, the year of [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|his debates]] with [[Stephen A. Douglas|Stephen Douglas]] over slavery]]

The debate over the status of slavery in the territories failed to alleviate tensions between the slave-holding South and the free North, with the failure of the [[Compromise of 1850]], a legislative package designed to address the issue.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=175–176}} In his 1852 eulogy for Clay, Lincoln highlighted the latter's support for gradual emancipation and opposition to &quot;both extremes&quot; on the slavery issue.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=182–185}} As the slavery debate in the [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]] and [[Kansas Territory|Kansas]] territories became particularly acrimonious, Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas proposed [[Popular sovereignty in the United States#Emergence of the term &quot;popular sovereignty&quot; and its pejorative connotation|popular sovereignty]] as a compromise; the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery. The legislation alarmed many Northerners, who sought to prevent the resulting spread of slavery, but Douglas's [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] narrowly passed Congress in May 1854.{{sfn|White|2009|p=188–190}}

Lincoln did not comment on the act until months later in his &quot;[[Abraham Lincoln's Peoria speech|Peoria Speech]]&quot; in October 1854. Lincoln then declared his opposition to slavery which he repeated en route to the presidency.{{sfn|Thomas|2008|pp=148–152}} He said the Kansas Act had a &quot;''declared'' indifference, but as I must think, a covert ''real'' zeal for the spread of slavery. I cannot but hate it. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world&amp;nbsp;...&quot;{{sfn|Graebner|1959|p=255}} Lincoln's attacks on the Kansas–Nebraska Act marked his return to political life.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=203–205}}

Nationally, the Whigs were irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue. Reflecting on the demise of his party, Lincoln wrote in 1855, &quot;I think I am a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist...I do no more than oppose the ''extension'' of slavery.&quot;{{sfn|White|2009|pp=215–216}} The new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery, drawing from the antislavery wing of the Whig Party, and combining [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]], [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty]], and antislavery [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] members,{{sfn|McGovern|2009|pp=38–39}} Lincoln resisted early Republican entreaties, fearing that the new party would become a platform for extreme abolitionists.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=203–204}} Lincoln held out hope for rejuvenating the Whigs, though he lamented his party's growing closeness with the nativist [[Know Nothing]] movement.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=191–194}}

In 1854 Lincoln was elected to the Illinois legislature but declined to take his seat. The year's elections showed the strong opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act, and in the aftermath, Lincoln sought election to the United States Senate.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=203–205}} At that time, senators were elected by the state legislature.{{sfn|Oates|1974|p=119}} After leading in the first six rounds of voting, he was unable to obtain a majority. Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for [[Lyman Trumbull]]. Trumbull was an antislavery Democrat, and had received few votes in the earlier ballots; his supporters, also antislavery Democrats, had vowed not to support any Whig. Lincoln's decision to withdraw enabled his Whig supporters and Trumbull's antislavery Democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream Democratic candidate, [[Joel Aldrich Matteson]].{{sfn|White|2009|pp=205–208}}

==== 1856 campaign ====
[[Bleeding Kansas|Violent political confrontations in Kansas]] continued, and opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act remained strong throughout the North. As the [[United States elections, 1856|1856 elections]] approached, Lincoln joined the Republicans and attended the [[Bloomington Convention]], which formally established the [[Illinois Republican Party]]. The convention platform endorsed Congress's right to regulate slavery in the territories and backed the admission of Kansas as a free state. Lincoln gave the [[Lincoln's Lost Speech|final speech]] of the convention supporting the party platform and called for the preservation of the Union.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=216–221}} At the June [[1856 Republican National Convention]], though Lincoln received support to run as vice president, [[John C. Frémont]] and [[William Dayton]] comprised the ticket, which Lincoln supported throughout Illinois. The Democrats nominated former Secretary of State [[James Buchanan]] and the Know-Nothings nominated former Whig President [[Millard Fillmore]].{{sfn|White|2009|pp=224–228}} Buchanan prevailed, while Republican [[William Henry Bissell]] won election as Governor of Illinois, and Lincoln became a leading Republican in Illinois.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=229–230}}{{efn|[[Eric Foner]] contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast, who saw slavery as a sin, with the conservative Republicans, who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the [[republicanism in the United States|republicanism principles]] of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].{{sfn|Foner|2010|pp=84–88}}}}
[[File:Oil on Canvas Portrait of Dred Scott (cropped).jpg|alt=Painting|thumb|A portrait of [[Dred Scott]], petitioner in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'']]

==== ''Dred Scott v. Sandford'' ====
[[Dred Scott]] was a slave whose master took him from a slave state to a free territory under the Missouri Compromise. After Scott was returned to the slave state he petitioned a federal court for his freedom. His petition was denied in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' (1857).{{Efn|While the name of the Supreme Court case is ''Dred Scott vs. Sandford'', the respondent's [[surname]] was actually &quot;Sanford&quot;.

Taney]] in the decision wrote that blacks were not citizens and derived no rights from the Constitution. While many Democrats hoped that ''Dred Scott'' would end the dispute over slavery in the territories, the decision sparked further outrage in the North.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=236–238}} Lincoln denounced it as the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the [[Slave Power]].{{sfn|Zarefsky|1993|pp=69–110}} He argued the decision was at variance with the Declaration of Independence; he said that while the founding fathers did not believe all men equal in every respect, they believed all men were equal &quot;in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&quot;.{{sfn|Jaffa|2000|pp=299–300}}

===Lincoln–Douglas debates and Cooper Union speech===
{{Further|Lincoln–Douglas debates|Cooper Union speech}}

In 1858 Douglas was up for re-election in the U.S. Senate, and Lincoln hoped to defeat him. Many in the party felt that a former Whig should be nominated in 1858, and Lincoln's 1856 campaigning and support of Trumbull had earned him a favor.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=247–248}} Some eastern Republicans supported Douglas from his opposition to the [[Lecompton Constitution]] and admission of Kansas as a [[slave state]].{{sfn|Oates|1974|pp=138–139}} Many Illinois Republicans resented this eastern interference. For the first time, Illinois Republicans held a convention to agree upon a Senate candidate, and Lincoln won the nomination with little opposition.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=247–250}}
[[File:Lincoln O-17 by Brady, 1860.png|thumb|left|Abraham Lincoln (1860) by [[Mathew Brady]], taken the day of the Cooper Union speech]]

Lincoln accepted the nomination with great enthusiasm and zeal. After his nomination he delivered his [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|House Divided Speech]], with the biblical reference [[Mark 3]]:25, &quot;A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.&quot;{{sfn|White|2009|p=251}} The speech created a stark image of the danger of disunion.{{sfn|Harris|2007|p=98}} The stage was then set for the election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=209}} When informed of Lincoln's nomination, Douglas stated, &quot;[Lincoln] is the strong man of the party&amp;nbsp;... and if I beat him, my victory will be hardly won.&quot;{{sfn|White|2009|pp=257–258}}

The Senate campaign featured seven [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|debates]] between Lincoln and Douglas. These were the most famous political debates in American history; they had an atmosphere akin to a prizefight and drew crowds in the thousands.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=214–218}} The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that Douglas’ &quot;Slave Power&quot; was threatening the values of republicanism, and accused Douglas of distorting the Founding Fathers' premise that [[all men are created equal]]. Douglas emphasized his [[Freeport Doctrine]], that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=214–224}} Lincoln's argument assumed a moral tone, as he claimed Douglas represented a conspiracy to promote slavery. Douglas's argument was more legal, claiming that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court in the ''Dred Scott'' decision.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=223}}

Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas. Lincoln's articulation of the issues gave him a national political presence.{{sfn|Carwardine|2003|pp=89–90}} In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the ''Illinois Staats-Anzeiger'', a German-language newspaper that was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted Democratically but the German-language paper mobilized Republican support.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=242, 412}} In the aftermath of the 1858 election, newspapers frequently mentioned Lincoln as a potential Republican presidential candidate, rivaled by [[William H. Seward]], [[Salmon P. Chase]], [[Edward Bates]], and [[Simon Cameron]]. While Lincoln was popular in the Midwest, he lacked support in the Northeast and was unsure whether to seek office.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=291–293}} In January 1860, Lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the nomination if offered, and in the following months' several local papers endorsed his candidacy.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=307–308}}

Traveling untiringly Lincoln made about fifty speeches. By their quality and simplicity, he quickly became the champion of the Republican party. However, unlike his overwhelming support in the [[Midwestern United States]] his support in the east was not as great, where he sometimes encountered a lack of appreciation and in some quarters was met with much indifference. [[Horace Greeley]], editor of the New York Tribune, at that time wrote up an unflattering account of Lincoln's compromising position on slavery and his reluctance to challenge the court's Dred-Scott ruling, which was promptly used against him by his political rivals.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=200}}{{sfn|Morse|1893|p=112}}

On February 27, 1860, powerful New York Republicans invited Lincoln to give a [[Cooper Union speech|speech at Cooper Union]], in which he argued that the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. He insisted that morality required opposition to slavery, and rejected any &quot;groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong&quot;.{{sfn|Jaffa|2000|p=473}} Many in the audience thought he appeared awkward and even ugly.{{sfn|Holzer|2004|pp=108–111}} But Lincoln demonstrated intellectual leadership that brought him into contention. Journalist [[Noah Brooks]] reported, &quot;No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience.&quot;{{sfnm|Carwardine|2003|1p=97|Holzer|2004|2p=157}}

Historian [[David Herbert Donald]] described the speech as a &quot;superb political move for an unannounced candidate, to appear in one rival's (Seward) own state at an event sponsored by the second rival's (Chase) loyalists, while not mentioning either by name during its delivery&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=240}} In response to an inquiry about his ambitions, Lincoln said, &quot;The taste ''is'' in my mouth a little.&quot;{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=241}}

On May 18, at the [[1860 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] in Chicago, Lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as Seward and Chase. A former Democrat, [[Hannibal Hamlin]] of Maine, was nominated for vice president to [[Ticket balance|balance the ticket]]. Lincoln's success depended on his campaign team, his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for internal improvements and the tariff.{{sfn|Luthin|1944|pp=609–629}}
Pennsylvania put him over the top, led by the state's iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support.{{sfn|Hofstadter|1938|pp=50–55}} Lincoln's managers had focused on this delegation while honoring Lincoln's dictate to &quot;Make no contracts that will bind me&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=247–250}}

As the Slave Power tightened its grip on the national government, most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party. Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln had doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession.{{sfn|Boritt|Pinsker|2002|pp=10, 13, 18}} When Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats, delegates from eleven slave states walked out of the [[1860 Democratic National Convention|Democratic convention]]; they opposed Douglas's position on popular sovereignty, and selected incumbent Vice President [[John C.

Prior to the Republican convention, the Lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization, the [[Wide Awakes]], which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives, thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties.&lt;ref name=Audacious&gt;{{cite book|title=Lincoln for President: An Unlikely Candidate, An Audacious Strategy, and the Victory No One Saw Coming|last=Chadwick|first=Bruce|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=2PQqZzyw4uAC|page=l49}}|pages=147–149|publisher=Sourcebooks|location=Naperville, Illinois|date=2009|access-date=April 1, 2017|isbn=978-1-4022-4756-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; People of the Northern states knew the Southern states would vote against Lincoln and rallied supporters for Lincoln.&lt;ref name=&quot;murrin&quot;&gt;Murrin, John (2006).

As Douglas and the other candidates campaigned, Lincoln gave no speeches, relying on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. Republican speakers focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the power of &quot;free labor&quot;, which allowed a common farm boy to work his way to the top by his own efforts.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=254–256}} The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a ''Chicago Tribune'' writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life and sold 100,000–200,000 copies.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=254}} Though he did not give public appearances, many sought to visit him and write him. In the runup to the election, he took an office in the Illinois state capitol to deal with the influx of attention. He also hired [[John George Nicolay]] as his personal secretary, who would remain in that role during the presidency.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=251-252|p=}}

On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th president. He was the first Republican president and his victory was entirely due to his support in the North and West. No ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states, an omen of the impending Civil War.{{sfn|Mansch|2005|p=61}}{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=256}} Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, or 39.8% of the total in a four-way race, carrying the free Northern states, as well as California and Oregon.{{sfn|White|2009|p=350}} His victory in the [[United States Electoral College|electoral college]] was decisive: Lincoln had 180 votes to 123 for his opponents.{{sfn|Nevins|1947|p=4:312}}

The South was outraged by Lincoln's election, and in response secessionists implemented plans to leave the Union before he took office in March 1861.{{sfn|Edgar|1998|p=350}} On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1p=267|Potter|1977|p2=498}} Six of these states declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the [[Confederate States of America]], and adopted a constitution.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=267}} The upper South and border states (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) initially rejected the secessionist appeal.{{sfn|White|2009|p=362}} President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy, declaring secession illegal.{{sfn|Potter|1977|pp=520, 569–570}} The Confederacy selected [[Jefferson Davis]] as its provisional president on February 9, 1861.{{sfn|White|2009|p=369}}

Attempts at compromise followed but Lincoln and the Republicans rejected the proposed [[Crittenden Compromise]] as contrary to the Party's platform of free-soil in the [[Territories of the United States|territories]].{{sfn|White|2009|pp=360–361}} Lincoln said, &quot;I will suffer death before I consent&amp;nbsp;... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right.&quot;{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=268}}

Lincoln tacitly supported the [[Corwin Amendment]] to the Constitution, which passed Congress and was awaiting ratification by the states when Lincoln took office. That doomed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed.{{sfnm|Vorenberg|2001|1p=22|Vile|2003|2pp=280–281}} A few weeks before the war, Lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution.{{sfn|Lupton|2006|p=34}}

{{Quote|Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that by the accession of a Republican Administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered. There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that &quot;I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.&quot;|[[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address|First inaugural address]], 4 March 1861{{sfn|Sandburg|2002|p=212}}|source=}} Lincoln cited his plans for banning the expansion of slavery as the key source of conflict between North and South, stating &quot;One section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial dispute.&quot; The president ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South: &quot;We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies&amp;nbsp;... The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.&quot;{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=283–284}} The failure of the [[Peace Conference of 1861]] signaled that legislative compromise was impossible. By March 1861, no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. Meanwhile, Lincoln and the Republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=268, 279}} In his [[Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]], Lincoln looked back on the situation at the time and said: &quot;Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the Nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came.&quot;

[[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Major Robert Anderson]], commander of the Union's [[Fort Sumter]] in Charleston, South Carolina, sent a request for provisions to Washington, and Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war. On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops [[Battle of Fort Sumter|at Fort Sumter]] and began the fight. Historian [[Allan Nevins]] argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and overlooking [[Southern Unionist]] opposition to an invasion.{{sfn|Nevins|1959|p=5:29}}

[[William Tecumseh Sherman]] talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was &quot;sadly disappointed&quot; at his failure to realize that &quot;the country was sleeping on a volcano&quot; and that the South was preparing for war.{{sfn|Sherman|1990|pp=185–186}} Donald concludes that, &quot;His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft. Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. But he also vowed not to surrender the forts. The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that.&quot;{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=293}}

On April 15, Lincoln called on the states to send a total of [[President Lincoln's 75,000 volunteers|75,000 volunteer troops]] to recapture forts, protect Washington, and &quot;preserve the Union&quot;, which, in his view, remained intact despite the seceding states. This call forced states to choose sides. Virginia seceded and was rewarded with the designation of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] as the Confederate capital, despite its exposure to Union lines. North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas followed over the following two months. Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland, but did not prevail; Kentucky remained neutral.{{sfn|Oates|1974|p=226}} The Fort Sumter attack rallied Americans north of the [[Mason-Dixon line]] to defend the nation.

As States sent Union regiments south, on April 19, Baltimore mobs in control of the rail links [[Baltimore riot of 1861|attacked Union troops]] who were changing trains. Local leaders' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital and the Army responded by arresting [[Maryland in the American Civil War#Imposition of martial law|local Maryland]] officials. Lincoln suspended the writ of ''[[Habeas corpus in the United States#Suspension during the Civil War|habeas corpus]]'' where needed for the security of troops trying to reach Washington.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|Coles|2002|p=174}} [[John Merryman]], one Maryland official hindering the U.S. troop movements, petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney to issue a writ of ''habeas corpus.'' In June Taney, ruling only for the lower circuit court in [[ex parte Merryman]], issued the writ which he felt could only be suspended by Congress. Lincoln persisted with the policy of suspension in select areas.{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=59–71}}{{sfn|Neely Jr.|1992|pp=3–31}}

====Union military strategy====
Lincoln took executive control of the war and shaped the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] military strategy. He responded to the unprecedented political and military crisis as [[commander-in-chief]] by exercising unprecedented authority. He expanded his war powers, imposed a blockade on Confederate ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, suspended ''habeas corpus'', and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln gained the support of Congress and the northern public for these actions. Lincoln also had to reinforce Union sympathies in the border slave states and keep the war from becoming an international conflict.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1pp=303–304|Carwardine|2003|2pp=163–164}}

Seward|William Seward]], [[Gideon Welles]], Lincoln, and others]]

It was clear from the outset that bipartisan support was essential to success, and that any compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on slavery. The Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=315–339, 417}} On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the [[Confiscation Act of 1861|Confiscation Act]] that authorized judicial proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederates. The law had little practical effect, but it signaled political support for abolishing slavery.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1p=314|Carwardine|2003|2p=178}}

In August 1861, General John C. Frémont, the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, without consulting Washington, issued a martial edict freeing slaves of the rebels. Lincoln canceled the illegal proclamation as politically motivated and lacking military necessity.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=314–317}} As a result, Union enlistments from Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000.{{sfn|Carwardine|2003|p=181}}

Internationally, Lincoln wanted to forestall foreign military aid to the Confederacy.{{sfn|Boritt|Pinsker|2002|pp=213–214}} He relied on his combative Secretary of State [[William Seward]] while working closely with [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] chairman [[Charles Sumner]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=322}} In the 1861 [[Trent Affair]] which threatened war with Great Britain, the U.S. Navy illegally intercepted a British mail ship, the ''Trent'', on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered. Lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats. Biographer [[James G. Randall]] dissected Lincoln's successful techniques:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=James Garfield|last= Randall|title=Lincoln the President: Springfield to Gettysburg|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=Vi8aAQAAIAAJ|page=50}}|year=1946|page=50|isbn=978-0-306-80754-1}} quoted in Peraino, Kevin (2013) ''Lincoln in the World: The Making of a Statesman and the Dawn of American Power''. pp. 160–61. {{ISBN|978-0-307-88720-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|his restraint, his avoidance of any outward expression of truculence, his early softening of State Department's attitude toward Britain, his deference toward Seward and Sumner, his withholding of his paper prepared for the occasion, his readiness to arbitrate, his golden silence in addressing Congress, his shrewdness in recognizing that war must be averted, and his clear perception that a point could be clinched for America's true position at the same time that satisfaction was given to a friendly country.}}

Lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraph reports coming into the War Department. He tracked all phases of the effort, consulting with governors, and selecting generals based on their success, their state, and their party. In January 1862, after complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department, Lincoln replaced [[United States Secretary of War|War Secretary]] Simon Cameron with [[Edwin Stanton]]. Stanton centralized the War Department's activities, auditing and canceling contracts, saving the federal government $17,000,000.{{sfn|Oates|1974|p=115}} Stanton was a staunch Unionist, pro-business, conservative Democrat who gravitated toward the Radical Republican faction. He worked more often and more closely with Lincoln than any other senior official. &quot;Stanton and Lincoln virtually conducted the war together&quot;, say Thomas and Hyman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=WTGTAAAAIAAJ|page=385}}|title=Stanton: The Life and Times of Lincoln's Secretary of War|last1=Thomas|first1=Benjamin Platt|last2=Hyman|first2=Harold Melvin|date=1962|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|pages= 71, 87, 229–30, 385 (quote)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's war strategy embraced two priorities: ensuring that Washington was well-defended and conducting an aggressive war effort for a prompt, decisive victory.{{efn|Major Northern newspapers, however, demanded more—they expected victory within 90 days.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=295–296}}}} Twice a week, Lincoln met with his cabinet in the afternoon. Occasionally Mary prevailed on him to take a carriage ride, concerned that he was working too hard.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=391–392}} For his edification Lincoln relied upon a book by his chief of staff General [[Henry Halleck]] entitled ''Elements of Military Art and Science''; Halleck was a disciple of the European strategist [[Antoine-Henri Jomini]]. Lincoln began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points, such as the [[Mississippi River]].{{sfn|Ambrose|1996|pp=7, 66, 159}} Lincoln saw the importance of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]] and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing territory.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=432–436}}

====General McClellan====
After the Union rout at [[First Battle of Bull Run|Bull Run]] and [[Winfield Scott]]'s retirement, Lincoln appointed Major General [[George B. McClellan]] general-in-chief.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=318–319}} McClellan then took months to plan his Virginia [[Peninsula Campaign]]. McClellan's slow progress frustrated Lincoln, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington. McClellan, in turn, blamed the failure of the campaign on Lincoln's reservation of troops for the capitol.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=349–352}}

[[File:Lincoln and McClellan 1862-10-03.jpg|alt=Photograph of Lincoln and McClellan sitting at a table in a field tent|thumb|Lincoln and McClellan]]
In 1862 Lincoln removed McClellan for the general's continued inaction. He elevated Henry Halleck in July and appointed [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]] as head of the new [[Army of Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.battlefields.org/learn/biographies/henry-w-halleck|title=Henry W.

Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan's failure to reinforce Pope, Lincoln restored him to command of all forces around Washington.{{sfn|Goodwin|2005|pp=478–479}} Two days after McClellan's return to command, General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s forces crossed the [[Potomac River]] into Maryland, leading to the [[Battle of Antietam]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2005|pp=478–480}} That battle, a Union victory, was among the bloodiest in American history; it facilitated Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in January.{{sfn|Goodwin|2005|p=481}}

McClellan then resisted the president's demand that he pursue Lee's withdrawing army, while General [[Don Carlos Buell]] likewise refused orders to move the [[Army of the Ohio]] against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee. Lincoln replaced Buell with [[William Rosecrans]]; and after the [[1862 and 1863 United States House of Representatives elections|1862 midterm elections]] he replaced McClellan with [[Ambrose Burnside]]. The appointments were both politically neutral and adroit on Lincoln's part.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=389–390}}

Burnside, against presidential advice, launched an offensive across the [[Rappahannock River]] and was [[Battle of Fredericksburg|defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg]] in December. Desertions during 1863 came in the thousands and only increased after Fredericksburg, so Lincoln replaced Burnside with [[Joseph Hooker]].{{sfnm|Nevins|1947|1pp=433–444|Donald|1996|2pp=429–431}}

In the 1862 midterm elections the Republicans suffered severe losses due to rising inflation, high taxes, rumors of corruption, suspension of ''habeas corpus'', [[Conscription|military draft law]], and fears that freed slaves would come North and undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation gained votes for Republicans in rural New England and the upper Midwest, but cost votes in the Irish and German strongholds and in the lower Midwest, where many Southerners had lived for generations.{{sfn|Nevins|1947|p=322}}

In the spring of 1863 Lincoln was sufficiently optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to think the end of the war could be near; the plans included attacks by Hooker on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans on Chattanooga, [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]] on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=422–423}}

Hooker was routed by Lee at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May, then resigned and was replaced by [[George Meade]].{{sfn|Nevins|1947|pp=432–450}} Meade followed Lee north into Pennsylvania and beat him in the [[Gettysburg Campaign]], but then failed to follow up despite Lincoln's demands. At the same time, Grant captured Vicksburg and gained control of the Mississippi River, splitting the far western rebel states.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=444–447}}

The Federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865 delegated the issue to the individual states. Lincoln argued that slavery would be rendered obsolete if its expansion into new territories were prevented. He sought to persuade the states to agree to [[compensated emancipation|compensation]] for emancipating their slaves in return for their acceptance of abolition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackubin&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/books/owens200403251139.asp |title=The Liberator |first=Thomas Owens |last=Mackubin |date=March 25, 2004 |work=National Review |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216125903/http://old.nationalreview.com/books/owens200403251139.asp |archive-date=February 16, 2012 |url-status=live |access-date=December 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln rejected Fremont's two emancipation attempts in August 1861, as well as one by Major General [[David Hunter]] in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power, and would upset loyal border states.{{sfn|Guelzo|1999|pp=290–291}}

In June 1862, Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory, which Lincoln signed. In July, the [[Confiscation Act of 1862]] was enacted, providing court procedures to free the slaves of those convicted of aiding the rebellion; Lincoln approved the bill despite his belief that it was unconstitutional. He felt such action could be taken only within the war powers of the commander-in-chief, which he planned to exercise. Lincoln at this time reviewed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=364–365}}

Privately, Lincoln concluded that the Confederacy's slave base had to be eliminated. Copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification; Republican editor [[Horace Greeley]] of the ''New York Tribune'' agreed.{{sfn|McPherson|1992|p=124}} In a letter of August 22, 1862, Lincoln said that while he personally wished all men could be free, regardless of that, his first obligation as president was to preserve the Union:{{sfn|Guelzo|2004|pp=147–153}}

{{Quote|My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union&amp;nbsp;... [¶] I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.{{sfn|Graebner|1959|p=388}}}}

The Emancipation Proclamation, issued on September 22, 1862, and effective January 1, 1863, affirmed the freedom of slaves in 10 states not then under Union control, with exemptions specified for areas under such control.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=364, 379}} Lincoln's comment on signing the Proclamation was: &quot;I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.&quot;{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=407}} He spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters by warning of the threat that freed slaves posed to northern whites.&lt;ref&gt;Louis P. Masur. (2012). ''Lincoln's Hundred Days: The Emancipation Proclamation and the War for the Union.'' Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the abolition of slavery in the rebel states now a military objective, Union armies advancing south liberated three million slaves.

Enlisting former slaves became official policy. By the spring of 1863, Lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers. In a letter to Tennessee military governor [[Andrew Johnson]] encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, &quot;The bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=430–431}} By the end of 1863, at Lincoln's direction, General [[Lorenzo Thomas]] had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=431}}

The Proclamation included Lincoln's earlier plans for [[Abraham Lincoln on slavery#Colonization|colonies]] for newly freed slaves, though that undertaking ultimately failed.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=408}}

====Gettysburg Address (1863)====
{{Main|Gettysburg Address}}
[[File:Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, Gettysburg, highlighted version.png|thumb|Lincoln, absent his usual top hat, is highlighted at Gettysburg.|alt=Large group of people]]
Lincoln spoke at the dedication of the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19, 1863.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=453–460}} In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted that the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, &quot;conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal&quot;. He defined the war as dedicated to the principles of liberty and equality for all. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end, and the future of democracy would be assured, that &quot;government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth&quot;.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1pp=460–466|Wills|2012|2pp=20, 27, 105, 146}}

Defying his prediction that &quot;the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here&quot;, the Address became the most quoted speech in American history.{{sfn|Bulla|Borchard|2010|p=222}}

&lt;/imagemap&gt;

[[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant's]] victories at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] and in the [[Vicksburg campaign]] impressed Lincoln. Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh, Lincoln had said, &quot;I can't spare this man. He fights.&quot;{{sfn|Thomas|2008|p=315}} With Grant in command, Lincoln felt the Union Army could advance in multiple theaters, while also including black troops. Meade's failure to capture Lee's army after Gettysburg and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to promote Grant to supreme commander. Grant then assumed command of Meade's army.{{sfn|Nevins|1947|pp=4:6–17}}

Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a presidential candidacy in 1864. He arranged for an intermediary to inquire into Grant's political intentions, and once assured that he had none, Lincoln promoted Grant to the newly revived rank of Lieutenant General, a rank which had been unoccupied since [[George Washington]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=490–492}} Authorization for such a promotion &quot;with the advice and consent of the Senate&quot; was provided by a new bill which Lincoln signed the same day he submitted Grant's name to the Senate. His nomination was confirmed by the Senate on March 2, 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/grant|title=Message of President Abraham Lincoln Nominating Ulysses S. Grant to Be Lieutenant General of the Army|date=August 15, 2016|website=National Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant in 1864 waged the bloody [[Overland Campaign]], which exacted heavy losses on both sides.{{sfn|McPherson|2009|p=113}} When Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were, the persistent general replied, &quot;I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.&quot;{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=501}} Grant's army moved steadily south. Lincoln traveled to Grant's headquarters at [[City Point, Virginia]], to confer with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehousehistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_about/whitehouse_collection/whitehouse_collection-art-06.html |title=The Peacemakers |publisher=The White House Historical Association |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927000627/http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_about/whitehouse_collection/whitehouse_collection-art-06.html |archive-date=September 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |access-date=May 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln reacted to Union losses by mobilizing support throughout the North.{{sfn|Thomas|2008|pp=422–424}} Lincoln authorized Grant to target infrastructure—plantations, railroads, and bridges—hoping to weaken the South's morale and fighting ability. He emphasized defeat of the Confederate armies over destruction (which was considerable) for its own sake.{{sfn|Neely Jr.|2004|pp=434–458}} Lincoln's engagement became distinctly personal on one occasion in 1864 when Confederate general [[Jubal Early]] [[Battle of Fort Stevens|raided Washington, D.C.]]. Legend has it that while Lincoln watched from an exposed position, Union Captain (and future [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court Justice]]) [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]] shouted at him, &quot;Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!&quot;{{sfn|Thomas|2008|p=434}}

As Grant continued to weaken Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President [[Alexander H. Stephens|Stephens]] led a group meeting with Lincoln, Seward, and others at [[Hampton Roads Conference|Hampton Roads]]. Lincoln refused to negotiate with the Confederacy as a coequal; his objective to end the fighting was not realized.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=565}} On April 1, 1865, Grant nearly encircled Petersburg in a siege. The Confederate government evacuated Richmond and Lincoln visited the conquered capital. On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox]], officially ending the war.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=589}}

[[File:Republican presidential ticket 1864b.jpg|thumb|A poster of the 1864 election campaign with Lincoln as the candidate for president and [[Andrew Johnson]] as the candidate for vice president]]

Lincoln ran for reelection in 1864, while uniting the main Republican factions, along with [[War Democrats]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]] and Andrew Johnson. Lincoln used conversation and his patronage powers—greatly expanded from peacetime—to build support and fend off the Radicals' efforts to replace him.{{sfnm|Fish|1902|1pp=53–69|Tegeder|1948|2pp=77–90}} At its convention, the Republicans selected Johnson as his running mate. To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new [[National Union Party (United States)|Union Party]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=494–507}}

Grant's bloody stalemates damaged Lincoln's re-election prospects, and many Republicans feared defeat. Lincoln confidentially pledged in writing that if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House;{{sfn|Grimsley|Simpson|2001|p=80}} Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope. The pledge read as follows:{{quote|text=This morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re-elected. Then it will be my duty to so co-operate with the President elect, as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lincoln|first=Abraham|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7/1:1124?rgn=div1;view=fulltext|title=Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln.

The Democratic platform followed the &quot;Peace wing&quot; of the party and called the war a &quot;failure&quot;; but their candidate, McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform. Meanwhile, Lincoln emboldened Grant with more troops and Republican party support. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September and [[David Farragut]]'s capture of Mobile ended defeatism.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=531}} The Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln. The National Union Party was united by Lincoln's support for emancipation. State Republican parties stressed the [[perfidy]] of the Copperheads.{{sfn|Randall|Current|1955|p=307}} On November 8, Lincoln carried all but three states, including 78 percent of Union soldiers.{{sfnm|1a1=Grimsley|1a2=Simpson|1y=2001|1p=80|2a1=Paludan|2y=1994|2pp=274–293}}

[[File:Abraham Lincoln second inaugural address.jpg|thumb|alt=A large crowd in front of a large building with many pillars|Lincoln's second inaugural address in 1865 at the almost completed Capitol building]]
On March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address. In it, he deemed the war casualties to be God's will. Historian [[Mark Noll]] places the speech &quot;among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world;&quot; it is inscribed in the [[Lincoln Memorial]].{{sfn|Noll|2002|p=426}} Lincoln said:

{{Quote|Fondly do we hope—fervently do we pray—that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the [[wikt:bondman|bond-man's]] 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said 3,000 years ago, so still it must be said, &quot;the judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether&quot;. With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan—to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln, Abraham ''Abraham Lincoln: Selected Speeches and Writings'' (Library of America edition, 2009) p 450&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Reconstruction===
{{Main|Reconstruction era}}
Reconstruction preceded the war's end, as Lincoln and his associates considered the reintegration of the nation, and the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves. When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates were to be treated, Lincoln replied, &quot;Let 'em up easy.&quot;{{sfn|Thomas|2008|pp=509–512}} Lincoln was determined to find meaning in the war in its aftermath, and did not want to continue to outcast the southern states. His main goal was to keep the union together, so he proceeded by focusing not on whom to blame, but on how to rebuild the nation as one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forged in Crisis: The Making of Five Legendary Leaders|last=Koehn|first=Nancy|publisher=Scribner|year=2017|isbn=978-1-5011-7444-5|location=NY|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln led the moderates in Reconstruction policy and was opposed by the Radicals, under Rep. [[Thaddeus Stevens]], Sen. Charles Sumner and Sen. [[Benjamin Wade]], who otherwise remained Lincoln's allies. Determined to reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held. His [[Ten percent plan|Amnesty Proclamation]] of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office and had not mistreated Union prisoners, if they were willing to sign an oath of allegiance.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=471–472}}

[[File:Lincoln and Johnsond.jpg|alt=Cartoon of Lincoln and Johnson attempting to stitch up the broken Union|thumb|A political cartoon of Vice President Andrew Johnson (a former tailor) and Lincoln, 1865, entitled ''The 'Rail Splitter' At Work Repairing the Union''. The caption reads (Johnson): &quot;Take it quietly Uncle Abe and I will draw it closer than ever.&quot; (Lincoln): &quot;A few more stitches Andy and the good old Union will be mended.&quot;]]

As Southern states fell, they needed leaders while their administrations were restored. In Tennessee and Arkansas, Lincoln respectively appointed Johnson and [[Frederick Steele]] as military governors. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] to promote a plan that would reestablish statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed, and only if the reconstructed states abolished slavery. Democratic opponents accused Lincoln of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. The Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the 1864 [[Wade–Davis Bill]], which Lincoln vetoed. The Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat elected representatives from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=485–486}}

Lincoln's appointments were designed to harness both moderates and Radicals. To fill Chief Justice Taney's seat on the Supreme Court, he named the Radicals' choice, Salmon P. Chase, who Lincoln believed would uphold his emancipation and paper money policies.{{sfn|Nevins|1947|p=4:206}}

After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the nation with a constitutional amendment. He declared that such an amendment would &quot;clinch the whole matter&quot; and by December 1863 an amendment was brought to Congress.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=561}} This first attempt fell short of the required two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives. Passage became part of Lincoln's reelection platform, and after his successful reelection, the second attempt in the House passed on January 31, 1865.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1pp=562–563|History.com}} With ratification, it became the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] on December 6, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Primary Documents in American History: 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/13thamendment.html |publisher=Library of Congress |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010110013/http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/13thamendment.html |archive-date=October 10, 2011 |url-status=live |access-date=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. He signed Senator Charles Sumner's [[Freedmen's Bureau]] bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate needs of former slaves. The law opened land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln announced a Reconstruction plan that involved short-term military control, pending readmission under the control of southern Unionists.{{sfn|Carwardine|2003|pp=242–243}}

Historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly how Reconstruction would have proceeded had Lincoln lived. Biographers James G. Randall and [[Richard Current]], according to David Lincove, argue that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lincove|first=David A.|title=Reconstruction in the United States: An Annotated Bibliography|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=3EQcT7-Dpi0C|page=80}}|year= 2000|publisher=Greenwood|page=80|isbn=978-0-313-29199-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|It is likely that had he lived, Lincoln would have followed a policy similar to Johnson's, that he would have clashed with congressional Radicals, that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred, and that his political skills would have helped him avoid Johnson's mistakes.}}

[[Eric Foner]] argues that:{{sfn|Foner|2010|p=335}}
{{Quote|Unlike Sumner and other Radicals, Lincoln did not see Reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation. He had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land. He believed, as most Republicans did in April 1865, that the voting requirements should be determined by the states. He assumed that political control in the South would pass to white Unionists, reluctant secessionists, and forward-looking former Confederates. But time and again during the war, Lincoln, after initial opposition, had come to embrace positions first advanced by abolitionists and Radical Republicans.&amp;nbsp;... Lincoln undoubtedly would have listened carefully to the outcry for further protection for the former slaves&amp;nbsp;... It is entirely plausible to imagine Lincoln and Congress agreeing on a Reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage, along the lines Lincoln proposed just before his death.}}

===Native American policy===
Lincoln's experience with Indians followed the death of his grandfather Abraham at their hands, in the presence of his father and uncles. Lincoln claimed Indians were antagonistic toward his father, Thomas Lincoln, and his young family. Although Lincoln was a veteran of the Black Hawk War, which was fought in Wisconsin and Illinois in 1832, he saw no significant action.{{sfn|Nichols|1974|p=3}} During his presidency, Lincoln's policy toward Indians was driven by politics.{{sfn|Nichols|1974|p=3}} He used the Indian Bureau as a source of patronage, making appointments to his loyal followers in Minnesota and Wisconsin.{{sfn|Nichols|1974|p=4}} He faced difficulties guarding Western settlers, railroads, and telegraphs, from Indian attacks.{{sfn|Nichols|1974|p=4}}

On August 17, 1862, the [[Dakota War of 1862|Dakota uprising]] in Minnesota, supported by the [[Yankton Sioux Tribe|Yankton Indians]], killed hundreds of white settlers, forced 30,000 from their homes, and deeply alarmed the Lincoln administration.{{sfn|Bulla|Borchard|2010|p=480}} Some believed it was a conspiracy by the Confederacy to launch a war on the Northwestern front.{{sfn|Nichols|1974|pp=4–5,7}} Lincoln sent General John Pope, the former head of the Army of Virginia, to Minnesota as commander of the new [[Department of the Northwest]].{{sfn|Nichols|1974|p=7}} Lincoln ordered thousands of Confederate prisoners of war sent by railroad to put down the Dakota Uprising.{{sfnm|Burlingame|2008|1p=481|Nichols|1974|2p=7}} When the Confederates protested forcing Confederate prisoners to fight Indians, Lincoln revoked the policy.{{sfn|Bulla|Borchard|2010|p=481}} Pope fought against the Indians mercilessly, even advocating their extinction. He ordered Indian farms and food supplies be destroyed, and Indian warriors be killed.{{sfn|Nichols|1974|p=7}} Aiding Pope, Minnesota Congressman Col. [[Henry Hastings Sibley|Henry H. Sibley]] led militiamen and regular troops to defeat the Dakota at [[Battle of Wood Lake|Wood Lake]].{{sfn|Bulla|Borchard|2010|p=481}} By October 9, Pope considered the uprising to be ended; hostilities ceased on December 26.{{sfn|Nichols|1974|p=8}} An unusual military court was set up to prosecute captured natives, with Lincoln effectively acting as the route of appeal.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chomsky|first=Carol|date=1990|title=The United States-Dakota War Trials: A Study in Military Injustice|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1228993|journal=Stanford Law Review|volume=43|issue=1|pages=13–98|doi=10.2307/1228993|jstor=1228993|issn=0038-9765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln personally reviewed each of 303 execution warrants for [[Sioux#Santee (Isáŋyathi or Eastern Dakota)|Santee Dakota]] convicted of killing innocent farmers; he commuted the sentences of all but 39 (one was later reprieved).{{sfn|Cox|2005|p=182}}&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Lincoln sought to be lenient, but still send a message. He also faced significant public pressure, including threats of mob justice should any of the Dakota be spared.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Former Governor of Minnesota [[Alexander Ramsey]] told Lincoln, in 1864, that he would have gotten more presidential election support had he executed all 303 of the Indians. Lincoln responded, &quot;I could not afford to hang men for votes.&quot;{{sfn|Bulla|Borchard|2010|p=483}}

===Other enactments===

In the selection and use of his cabinet, Lincoln employed the strengths of his opponents in a manner that emboldened his presidency. Lincoln commented on his thought process, &quot;We need the strongest men of the party in the Cabinet. We needed to hold our own people together. I had looked the party over and concluded that these were the very strongest men. Then I had no right to deprive the country of their services.&quot; {{sfn|Goodwin|2005|p=319}} Goodwin described the group in her biography as a ''[[Team of Rivals]]''.{{sfn|Goodwin|2005}}

Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of a presidency focused on executing laws while deferring to Congress' responsibility for legislating. Lincoln vetoed only four bills, including the [[Wade-Davis Bill]] with its harsh Reconstruction program.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=137}} The [[1862 Homestead Act]] made millions of acres of Western government-held land available for purchase at low cost. The 1862 [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]] provided government grants for [[List of agricultural universities and colleges|agricultural colleges]] in each state. The [[Pacific Railway Acts]] of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], which was completed in 1869.{{sfn|Paludan|1994|p=116}} The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was enabled by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.{{sfn|McPherson|2009|pp=450–452}}

There were two measures passed to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a [[Income tax in the United States|Federal income tax]]. In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third [[Morrill Tariff]]s, following the first enacted by Buchanan. He also signed the [[Revenue Act of 1861]], creating the first U.S. income tax—a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|800|1861|r=-2}}}} in current dollar terms).{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=424}} The [[Revenue Act of 1862]] adopted rates that increased with income.{{sfn|Paludan|1994|p=111}}

Lincoln presided over the expansion of the federal government's economic influence in other areas. The [[National Banking Act]] created the system of national banks. The US issued paper currency for the first time, known as [[Greenback (1860s money)|greenbacks]]—printed in green on the reverse side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brands |first=H.

In response to rumors of a renewed draft, the editors of the ''[[New York World]]'' and the ''[[The Journal of Commerce|Journal of Commerce]]'' published a false draft proclamation that created an opportunity for the editors and others to corner the gold market. Lincoln attacked the media for such behavior, and ordered a military seizure of the two papers which lasted for two days.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=501–502}}

Lincoln is largely responsible for the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving holiday]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=471}} Thanksgiving had become a regional holiday in New England in the 17th century. It had been sporadically proclaimed by the federal government on irregular dates. The prior proclamation had been during [[James Madison]]'s presidency 50 years earlier. In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=471}}

In June 1864, Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as [[Yosemite National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schaffer|first=Jeffrey P.|title=Yosemite National Park: A Natural History Guide to Yosemite and Its Trails|publisher=Wilderness Press|page=48|location=Berkeley|year=1999|isbn=978-0-89997-244-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's philosophy on court nominations was that &quot;we cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it. Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known.&quot;{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=471}} Lincoln made five appointments to the Supreme Court. [[Noah Haynes Swayne]] was an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union. [[Samuel Freeman Miller]] supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist. David Davis was Lincoln's campaign manager in 1860 and had served as a judge in the Illinois court circuit where Lincoln practiced. Democrat [[Stephen Johnson Field]], a previous California Supreme Court justice, provided geographic and political balance. Finally, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary, Salmon P. Chase, became Chief Justice. Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party.{{sfn|Blue|1987|p=245}}

[[John Wilkes Booth]] was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=586–587}} After attending an April 11, 1865 speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, Booth hatched a plot to assassinate the President.{{sfn|Harrison|2010|pp=3–4}} When Booth learned of the Lincolns' intent to attend a play with General Grant, he planned to assassinate Lincoln and Grant at [[Ford's Theatre]]. Lincoln and his wife attended the play ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' on the evening of April 14, just five days after the Union victory at the [[Battle of Appomattox Courthouse]]. At the last minute, Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=594–597}}

At 10:15 in the evening, Booth entered the back of Lincoln's theater box, crept up from behind, and fired at the back of Lincoln's head, mortally wounding him. Lincoln's guest Major [[Henry Rathbone]] momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1p=597|Martin|2010}} After being attended by [[Charles Leale|Doctor Charles Leale]] and two other doctors, Lincoln was taken across the street to [[Petersen House]].

Two weeks later, Booth, refusing to surrender, was tracked to a farm in Virginia, and was mortally shot by Sergeant [[Boston Corbett]] and died on April 26.

As a young man, Lincoln was a [[religious skepticism|religious skeptic]].{{sfnm|Carwardine|2003|1p=4|Wilson|1999|2p=84}} He was deeply familiar with the [[Bible]], quoting and praising it.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=48–49, 514–515}} He was private about his position on organized religion and respected the beliefs of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lincoln|first=Abraham|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln1/1:403?rgn=div1;view=fulltext|title=Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln.

In the 1840s, Lincoln subscribed to the [[The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated|Doctrine of Necessity]], a belief that the human mind was controlled by a higher power.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=48–49}} With the death of his son Edward in 1850 he more frequently expressed a dependence on God.{{sfn|Parrillo|2000|pp=227–253}} He never joined a church, although he frequently attended [[First Presbyterian Church (Springfield, Illinois)|First Presbyterian Church]] with his wife beginning in 1852.{{sfn|White|2009|p=180}}{{efn|On claims that Lincoln was baptized by an associate of [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]], see {{cite journal|url=http://www.acu.edu/sponsored/restoration_quarterly/archives/1990s/vol_38_no_2_contents/martin.html |last=Martin |first=Jim |title=The secret baptism of Abraham Lincoln |journal=Restoration Quarterly |volume=38 |issue=2 |year=1996 |access-date=May 27, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019204330/http://www.acu.edu/sponsored/restoration_quarterly/archives/1990s/vol_38_no_2_contents/martin.html |archive-date=October 19, 2012 }}}}

In the 1850s, Lincoln asserted his belief in &quot;providence&quot; in a general way, and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=g9EynQEACAAJ}}|title=&quot;Our Country&quot;: Northern Evangelicals and the Union During the Civil War and Reconstruction|last=Brodrecht|first=Grant R.|date=2008|publisher=University of Notre Dame}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death of son Willie in February 1862 may have caused him to look toward religion for solace.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|pp=251–254}} After Willie's death, he questioned the divine necessity of the war's severity. He wrote at this time that God &quot;could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun, He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds.&quot;{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=254}}

Lincoln did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and by 1865 was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.{{sfn|Noll|1992}} By the end of the war, he increasingly appealed to the Almighty for solace and to explain events, writing on April 4, 1864, to a newspaper editor in Kentucky: &lt;blockquote&gt;I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me. Now, at the end of three years struggle the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man devised, or expected. God alone can claim it. Whither it is tending seems plain.

{{See also|Cultural depictions of Abraham Lincoln}}

=== Republican values ===
Lincoln's redefinition of ''[[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]]'' has been stressed by historians such as [[John Patrick Diggins]], [[Harry V. Jaffa]], [[Vernon Burton]], Eric Foner, and Herman J. Belz.{{sfn|Thomas|2008|p=61}} Lincoln called the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]—which emphasized freedom and equality for all—the &quot;[[sheet anchor]]&quot; of republicanism beginning in the 1850s. He did this at a time when the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]], which &quot;tolerated slavery&quot;, was the focus of most political discourse.{{sfnm|Jaffa|2000|1p=399|Thomas|2008|2p=61}} Diggins notes, &quot;Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself&quot; in the 1860 Cooper Union speech.{{sfnm|Diggins|1986|1p=307|Thomas|2008|2p=61}} Instead of focusing on the legality of an argument, he focused on the moral basis of republicanism.{{sfnm|Foner|2010|1p=215|Thomas|2008|2p=61}}

His position on war was founded on a legal argument regarding the Constitution as essentially a contract among the states, and all parties must agree to pull out of the contract. Furthermore, it was a national duty to ensure the republic stands in every state.{{sfnm|Jaffa|2000|1p=263|Thomas|2008|2p=61}} Many soldiers and religious leaders from the north, though, felt the fight for liberty and freedom of slaves was ordained by their moral and religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=_zaSs2HzEEwC|page=243}}|title=The Age of Lincoln: A History|last=Burton|first=Orville Vernon|date=2008|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-1-4299-3955-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a Whig activist, Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests, favoring high tariffs, banks, infrastructure improvements, and railroads, in opposition to [[Jacksonian democrats]].{{sfn|Boritt|Pinsker|2002|pp=196–198, 229–231, 301}} [[William C. Harris (historian)|William C. Harris]] found that Lincoln's &quot;reverence for the Founding Fathers, the Constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions strengthened his conservatism.&quot;{{sfn|Harris|2007|p=2}} James G. Randall emphasizes his tolerance and moderation &quot;in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform.&quot; Randall concludes that &quot;he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called 'radicalism' which involved abuse of the South, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders.&quot;{{sfn|Randall|1962|p=175}}

===Reunification of the states===
{{CSS image crop|Image=LINCOLN, Abraham-President (BEP engraved portrait).jpg |bSize= 226|cWidth= 165|cHeight= 195|oTop= 33|oLeft= 31|Location= right|Description= [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] portrait of Lincoln as president}}
In Lincoln's first inaugural address, he explored the nature of democracy. He denounced secession as anarchy, and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints. He said &quot;A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.&quot;{{sfn|Belz|1998|p=86}}

The successful reunification of the states had consequences for how people viewed the country. The term &quot;the United States&quot; has historically been used, sometimes in the plural (&quot;these United States&quot;), and other times in the singular. The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Burt |first=Andrew |date=May 13, 2013 |title='These United States': How Obama's Vocal Tic Reveals a Polarized America |magazine=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/05/these-united-states-how-obamas-vocal-tic-reveals-a-polarized-america/275739/ |access-date=February 14, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's assassination left him a national martyr. He was viewed by abolitionists as a champion of human liberty. Republicans linked Lincoln's name to their party. Many, though not all, in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability.{{sfn|Chesebrough|1994|pp=76, 79, 106, 110}} Historians have said he was &quot;a [[classical liberal]]&quot; in the 19th-century sense. [[Allen C. Guelzo]] states that Lincoln was a &quot;classical liberal democrat—an enemy of artificial hierarchy, a friend to trade and business as ennobling and enabling, and an American counterpart to Mill, Cobden, and Bright&quot;, whose portrait Lincoln hung in his White House office.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fornieri&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first1=Joseph R.|last1=Fornieri|first2=Sara Vaughn|last2=Gabbard|title=Lincoln's America: 1809–1865|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=Xarqzbuf43sC|page=19}}|year=2008|publisher=[[SIU Press]]|location=Carbondale, Illinois|isbn=978-0-8093-8713-7|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Randall|1962|pp=65–87}}

Schwartz argues that Lincoln's American reputation grew slowly from the late 19th century until the [[Progressive Era]] (1900–1920s), when he emerged as one of America's most venerated heroes, even among white Southerners. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C.{{sfn|Schwartz|2000|p=109}}

Union nationalism, as envisioned by Lincoln, &quot;helped lead America to the nationalism of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Woodrow Wilson]], and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.&quot;{{sfn|Boritt|Pinsker|2002|p=222}} In the [[New Deal]] era, liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the [[self-made man]] or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they claimed would have supported the [[welfare state]].{{sfn|Schwartz|2008|pp=23, 91–98}}
[[File:United States penny, obverse, 2002.png|thumb|The [[Lincoln cent]], an American coin portraying Lincoln]]

Sociologist [[Barry Schwartz (sociologist)|Barry Schwartz]] argues that in the 1930s and 1940s the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with &quot;a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life.&quot; During the [[Great Depression]], he argues, Lincoln served &quot;as a means for seeing the world's disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful&quot;. Franklin D. Roosevelt, preparing America for war, used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan. Americans asked, &quot;What would Lincoln do?&quot;{{sfn|Schwartz|2008|pp=xi, 9, 24}} However, Schwartz also finds that since World War II Lincoln's symbolic power has lost relevance, and this &quot;fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness.&quot; He suggested that [[postmodernism]] and [[multiculturalism]] have diluted greatness as a concept.{{sfn|Schwartz|2008|pp=xi, 9}}

In the [[Cold War]] years, Lincoln's image shifted to a symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by [[Communist regime]]s.{{sfn|Schwartz|2008|pp=23, 91–98}} By the late 1960s, some African-American intellectuals, led by [[Lerone Bennett Jr.]], rejected Lincoln's role as the Great Emancipator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Arthur|last=Zilversmit|title=Lincoln and the Problem of Race: A Decade of Interpretations|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0002.104/--lincoln-and-the-problem-of-race-a-decade-of-interpretations?rgn=main;view=fulltext|journal=Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association|publisher=Abraham Lincoln Association|location=Springfield, Illinois|volume=2|issue=1|date=1980|pages=22–24|access-date=December 2, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025185706/http://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0002.104/--lincoln-and-the-problem-of-race-a-decade-of-interpretations?rgn=main;view=fulltext|archive-date=October 25, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=John M.|last=Barr|title=Holding Up a Flawed Mirror to the American Soul: Abraham Lincoln in the Writings of Lerone Bennett Jr.|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0035.105/--holding-up-a-flawed-mirror-to-the-american-soul-abraham?keywords=rgn...;rgn=main;view=fulltext|journal=Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association|publisher=Abraham Lincoln Association|location=Springfield, Illinois|volume=35|issue=1|date=Winter 2014|pages=43–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a [[white supremacist]] in 1968.{{sfn|Bennett Jr.|1968|pp=35–42}} He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks. Bennett argued that Lincoln opposed social equality, and proposed sending freed slaves to another country. Defenders, such as authors Dirck and Cashin, retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day;{{sfn|Dirck|2008|p=31}} and that he was a &quot;moral visionary&quot; who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible.{{sfn|Striner|2006|pp=2–4}} The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashin|1y=2002|1p=61|2a1=Kelley|2a2=Lewis|2y=2005|2p=228}}

By the 1970s, Lincoln had become a hero to [[Conservatism in the United States|political conservatives]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=p6yMTe4j_YEC|page=96}}|title=Lincoln and the Politics of Christian Love|last=Havers|first=Grant N.|page=96|date=November 13, 2009|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=978-0-8262-1857-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; apart from [[neo-Confederates]] such as [[Mel Bradford]] who denounced his treatment of the white South, for his intense nationalism, support for business, his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage, his acting in terms of [[Lockean]] and [[Burkean]] principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition, and his devotion to the principles of the Founding Fathers.{{sfnm|Belz|2014|1pp=514–518|Graebner|1959|2pp=67–94|Smith|2010|3pp=43–45}} Lincoln became a favorite exemplar for liberal intellectuals across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Richard|editor1-last=Carwardine|editor2-first=Jay|editor2-last=Sexton|title=The Global Lincoln|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=Gs_1lpJvF34C|page=54}}|year=2011|publisher=Oxford UP|location=Oxford, England|isbn=978-0-19-537911-2|pages=7, 9–10, 54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Barry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln's image suffered &quot;erosion, fading prestige, benign ridicule&quot; in the late 20th century.{{sfn|Schwartz|2008|p=146}} On the other hand, Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of [[negative capability]], defined by the poet [[John Keats]] and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were &quot;content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts, and not compelled toward fact or reason&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=15}}

Anti-Equilibrium was formed in part in the belief that reality and theory should form an integral unit while blending elements of organization theory, information theory, management science and the new disequilibrium economics. The theory was published in the 1971 book Anti-equilibrium On economic systems theory and the tasks of research written by [János Kornai]. Anti-Equilibrium criticizes [neoclassical economics], particularly [Walras's law] and [general equilibrium theory].&lt;ref&gt;Móczár, J. (2018). János Kornai, and neoclassical versus institutional economics, Acta Oeconomica Acta Oeconomica, 68(s1), 73-83. Retrieved Nov 1, 2021, from https://akjournals.com/view/journals/032/68/s1/article-p73.xml&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;
Kornai János. Anti-Equilibrium: On Economic Systems Theory and the Tasks of Research. North-Holland, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;


Peter Mihalyi best summarized the importance emphasis of Anti-Equilibrium points with the following quote &lt;ref&gt;  Mihalyi, P. (2013, September 1). János Kornai’s anti-equilibrium, a harbinger of evolutionary economics. Akadémiai Kiadó. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264746540_Janos_Kornai’s_Anti-Equilibrium_a_Harbinger_of_Evolutionary_Economics
&lt;/ref&gt;
# &quot;economics should draw from biology, rather than physics, as its methodological underpinning&quot;
# &quot;evolutionary logic requires a different type of decision-making in simple, routine matters, as opposed to large and important decisions&quot;
# &quot;the most important production processes are non-linear, with increasing returns to scale being the rule, rather than the exception in modern capitalist economies and — in conclusion — that there is no such thing as general equilibrium. In modern societies, goods and services are either in shortage (Socialism) or in a state of oversupply (Capitalism). It is either a buyers’ market or sellers’ market.&quot;

      <text bytes="25896" xml:space="preserve">Stephen Grover Cleveland (March 18, 1837 – June 24, 1908) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 22nd and 24th president of the United States from 1885 to 1889 and from 1893 to 1897. Cleveland is the only president in American history to serve two nonconsecutive terms in office.[b] He won the popular vote for three presidential elections—in 1884, 1888, and 1892—and was one of two Democrats (followed by Woodrow Wilson in 1912) to be elected president during the era of Republican presidential domination dating from 1861 to 1933.

In 1881, Cleveland was elected mayor of Buffalo and later, governor of New York. He was the leader of the pro-business Bourbon Democrats who opposed high tariffs; Free Silver; inflation; imperialism; and subsidies to business, farmers, or veterans. His crusade for political reform and fiscal conservatism made him an icon for American conservatives of the era.[1] Cleveland won praise for his honesty, self-reliance, integrity, and commitment to the principles of classical liberalism.[2] He fought political corruption, patronage, and bossism. As a reformer, Cleveland had such prestige that the like-minded wing of the Republican Party, called &quot;Mugwumps&quot;, largely bolted the GOP presidential ticket and swung to his support in the 1884 election.[3] As his second administration began, disaster hit the nation when the Panic of 1893 produced a severe national depression. It ruined his Democratic Party, opening the way for a Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896. The result was a political realignment that ended the Third Party System and launched the Fourth Party System and the Progressive Era.[4]

Cleveland was a formidable policymaker, and he also drew corresponding criticism. His intervention in the Pullman Strike of 1894 to keep the railroads moving angered labor unions nationwide in addition to the party in Illinois; his support of the gold standard and opposition to Free Silver alienated the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party.[5] Critics complained that Cleveland had little imagination and seemed overwhelmed by the nation's economic disasters—depressions and strikes—in his second term.[5] Even so, his reputation for probity and good character survived the troubles of his second term. Biographer Allan Nevins wrote, &quot;[I]n Grover Cleveland, the greatness lies in typical rather than unusual qualities. He had no endowments that thousands of men do not have. He possessed honesty, courage, firmness, independence, and common sense. But he possessed them to a degree other men do not.&quot;[6] By the end of his second term, public perception showed him to be one of the most unpopular U.S. presidents, and he was by then rejected even by most Democrats.[7] Today, Cleveland is considered by most historians to have been a successful leader, and has been praised for honesty, integrity, adherence to his morals and defying party boundaries, and effective leadership. He is generally ranked among the upper-mid tier of American presidents.

Early life
Childhood and family history

Caldwell Presbyterian parsonage, birthplace of Grover Cleveland in Caldwell, New Jersey
Stephen Grover Cleveland was born on March 18, 1837, in Caldwell, New Jersey, to Ann (née Neal) and Richard Falley Cleveland.[8] Cleveland's father was a Congregational and Presbyterian minister who was originally from Connecticut.[9] His mother was from Baltimore and was the daughter of a bookseller.[10] On his father's side, Cleveland was descended from English ancestors, the first of the family having emigrated to Massachusetts from Cleveland, England in 1635.[11] His father's maternal grandfather, Richard Falley Jr., fought at the Battle of Bunker Hill, and was the son of an immigrant from Guernsey. On his mother's side, Cleveland was descended from Anglo-Irish Protestants and German Quakers from Philadelphia.[12] Cleveland was distantly related to General Moses Cleaveland, after whom the city of Cleveland, Ohio, was named.[13]

Cleveland, the fifth of nine children, was named Stephen Grover in honor of the first pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Caldwell, where his father was pastor at the time. He became known as Grover in his adult life.[14] In 1841, the Cleveland family moved to Fayetteville, New York, where Grover spent much of his childhood.[15] Neighbors later described him as &quot;full of fun and inclined to play pranks,&quot;[16] and fond of outdoor sports.[17]

In 1850, Cleveland's father Richard moved his family to Clinton, New York, to work as district secretary for the American Home Missionary Society.[18] Despite his father's dedication to his missionary work, his income was insufficient for the large family. Financial conditions forced him to remove Grover from school and place him in a two-year mercantile apprenticeship in Fayetteville. The experience was valuable and brief, and the living conditions quite austere. Grover returned to Clinton and his schooling at the completion of the apprentice contract.[19] In 1853, when missionary work began to take a toll on the health of Cleveland's father, he took an assignment in Holland Patent, New York (near Utica) and moved his family again.[20] Shortly after, he died from a gastric ulcer. The younger Cleveland was said to have learned about his father's death from a boy selling newspapers.[20]

Education and moving west

Cleveland received his elementary education at the Fayetteville Academy and the Clinton Liberal Academy.[21] After his father died in 1853, he again left school to help support his family. Later that year, Cleveland's brother William was hired as a teacher at the New York Institute for the Blind in New York City, and William obtained a place for Cleveland as an assistant teacher. Cleveland returned home to Holland Patent at the end of 1854, where an elder in his church offered to pay for his college education if he would promise to become a minister. Cleveland declined, and in 1855 he decided to move west.[22]

He stopped first in Buffalo, New York, where his uncle, Lewis F. Allen, gave him a clerical job.[23] Allen was an important man in Buffalo, and he introduced his nephew to influential men there, including the partners in the law firm of Rogers, Bowen, and Rogers.[24] Millard Fillmore, the 13th president of the United States, had previously worked for the partnership.[25] Cleveland later took a clerkship with the firm, began to read the law with them, and was admitted to the New York bar in 1859.[26]

Early career and the Civil War
Cleveland worked for the Rogers firm for three years before leaving in 1862 to start his own practice.[27] In January 1863, he was appointed assistant district attorney of Erie County.[28] With the American Civil War raging, Congress passed the Conscription Act of 1863, requiring able-bodied men to serve in the army if called upon, or else to hire a substitute.[26] Cleveland chose the latter course, paying $150 (equivalent to $3,153 in 2020) to George Benninsky, a thirty-two-year-old Polish immigrant, to serve in his place.[29] Benninsky survived the war.[26]

As a lawyer, Cleveland became known for his single-minded concentration and dedication to hard work.[30] In 1866, he successfully defended some participants in the Fenian raid, working on a pro bono basis (free of charge).[31] In 1868, Cleveland attracted professional attention for his winning defense of a libel suit against the editor of Buffalo's Commercial Advertiser.[32] During this time, Cleveland assumed a lifestyle of simplicity, taking residence in a plain boarding house. He devoted his growing income instead to the support of his mother and younger sisters.[33] While his personal quarters were austere, Cleveland enjoyed an active social life and &quot;the easy-going sociability of hotel-lobbies and saloons.&quot;[34] He shunned the circles of higher society of Buffalo in which his uncle's family traveled.[35]

Political career in New York
Sheriff of Erie County

From his earliest involvement in politics, Cleveland aligned with the Democratic Party.[36] He had a decided aversion to Republicans John Fremont and Abraham Lincoln, and the heads of the Rogers law firm were solid Democrats.[37] In 1865, he ran for District Attorney, losing narrowly to his friend and roommate, Lyman K. Bass, the Republican nominee.[30]

In 1870, with the help of friend Oscar Folsom, Cleveland secured the Democratic nomination for Sheriff of Erie County, New York.[38] He won the election by a 303-vote margin and took office on January 1, 1871, at age 33.[39][40] While this new career took him away from the practice of law, it was rewarding in other ways: the fees were said to yield up to $40,000 (equivalent to $864,111 in 2020) over the two-year term.[38]

Cleveland's service as sheriff was unremarkable; biographer Rexford Tugwell described the time in office as a waste for Cleveland politically. Cleveland was aware of graft in the sheriff's office during his tenure and chose not to confront it.[41] A notable incident of his term took place on September 6, 1872, when Patrick Morrissey was executed. He had been convicted of murdering his mother.[42] As sheriff, Cleveland was responsible for either personally carrying out the execution or paying a deputy $10 to perform the task.[42] In spite of reservations about the hanging, Cleveland executed Morrissey himself.[42] He hanged another murderer, John Gaffney, on February 14, 1873.[43]

After his term as sheriff ended, Cleveland returned to his law practice, opening a firm with his friends Lyman K. Bass and Wilson S. Bissell.[44] Elected to Congress in 1872, Bass did not spend much time at the firm, but Cleveland and Bissell soon rose to the top of Buffalo's legal community.[45] Up to that point, Cleveland's political career had been honorable and unexceptional. As biographer Allan Nevins wrote, &quot;Probably no man in the country, on March 4, 1881, had less thought than this limited, simple, sturdy attorney of Buffalo that four years later he would be standing in Washington and taking the oath as President of the United States.&quot;[46]

It was during this period that Cleveland began courting a widow, Maria Halpin. She later accused him of raping her.[47][48] He accused her of being an alcoholic and consorting with men. In an attempt to discredit her, he had her institutionalized and had their child taken away and raised by his friends. The institution quickly realized that she did not belong there and released her.[49] The illegitimate child became a campaign issue for the GOP in Cleveland's first presidential campaign.[50]

Mayor of Buffalo
In the 1870s, the municipal government in Buffalo had grown increasingly corrupt, with Democratic and Republican political machines cooperating to share the spoils of political office.[51] In 1881 the Republicans nominated a slate of particularly disreputable machine politicians; the Democrats saw the opportunity to gain the votes of disaffected Republicans by nominating a more honest candidate.[52] The party leaders approached Cleveland, and he agreed to run for Mayor of Buffalo, provided that the rest of the ticket was to his liking.[53] When the more notorious politicians were left off the Democratic ticket, Cleveland accepted the nomination.[53] Cleveland was elected mayor with 15,120 votes, as against 11,528 for Milton C. Beebe, his opponent.[54] He took office January 2, 1882.

Cleveland's term as mayor was spent fighting the entrenched interests of the party machines.[55] Among the acts that established his reputation was a veto of the street-cleaning bill passed by the Common Council.[56] The street-cleaning contract had been competed for bidding, and the Council selected the highest bidder at $422,000, rather than the lowest of $100,000 less, because of the political connections of the bidder.[56] While this sort of bipartisan graft had previously been tolerated in Buffalo, Mayor Cleveland would have none of it. His veto message said, &quot;I regard it as the culmination of a most bare-faced, impudent, and shameless scheme to betray the interests of the people, and to worse than squander the public money.&quot;[57] The Council reversed itself and awarded the contract to the lowest bidder.[58] Cleveland also asked the state legislature to form a Commission to develop a plan to improve the sewer system in Buffalo at a much lower cost than previously proposed locally; this plan was successfully adopted.[59] For this, and other actions safeguarding public funds, Cleveland began to gain a reputation beyond Erie County as a leader willing to purge government corruption.[60]

Governor of New York

Gubernatorial portrait of Grover Cleveland
New York Democratic party officials began to consider Cleveland a possible nominee for governor.[61] Daniel Manning, a party insider who admired Cleveland's record, was instrumental in his candidacy.[62] With a split in the state Republican party in 1882, the Democratic party was considered to be at an advantage; several men contended for that party's nomination.[61] The two leading Democratic candidates were Roswell P. Flower and Henry W. Slocum. Their factions deadlocked, and the convention could not agree on a nominee.[63] Cleveland, in third place on the first ballot, picked up support in subsequent votes and emerged as the compromise choice.[64] The Republican party remained divided, and in the general election Cleveland emerged the victor, with 535,318 votes to Republican nominee Charles J. Folger's 342,464.[65] Cleveland's margin of victory was, at the time, the largest in a contested New York election; the Democrats also picked up seats in both houses of the New York State Legislature.[66]

Cleveland brought his opposition to needless spending to the governor's office; he promptly sent the legislature eight vetoes in his first two months in office.[67] The first to attract attention was his veto of a bill to reduce the fares on New York City elevated trains to five cents.[68] The bill had broad support because the trains' owner, Jay Gould, was unpopular, and his fare increases were widely denounced.[69] Cleveland, however, saw the bill as unjust—Gould had taken over the railroads when they were failing and had made the system solvent again.[70] Moreover, Cleveland believed that altering Gould's franchise would violate the Contract Clause of the federal Constitution.[70] Despite the initial popularity of the fare-reduction bill, the newspapers praised Cleveland's veto.[70] Theodore Roosevelt, then a member of the Assembly, had reluctantly voted for the bill to which Cleveland objected, in a desire to punish the unscrupulous railroad barons.[71] After the veto, Roosevelt reversed himself, as did many legislators, and the veto was sustained.[71]

Cleveland's defiance of political corruption won him popular acclaim, and the enmity of the influential Tammany Hall organization in New York City.[72] Tammany, under its boss, John Kelly, had disapproved of Cleveland's nomination as governor, and their resistance intensified after Cleveland openly opposed and prevented the re-election of Thomas F. Grady, their point man in the State Senate.[73] Cleveland also steadfastly opposed nominees of the Tammanyites, as well as bills passed as a result of their deal-making.[74] The loss of Tammany's support was offset by the support of Theodore Roosevelt and other reform-minded Republicans who helped Cleveland to pass several laws reforming municipal governments.[75]

The Republicans convened in Chicago and nominated former Speaker of the House James G. Blaine of Maine for president on the fourth ballot. Blaine's nomination alienated many Republicans who viewed Blaine as ambitious and immoral.[76] The GOP standard-bearer was weakened by alienating the Mugwumps, and the Conkling faction, recently disenfranchised by President Chester Arthur.[77] Democratic party leaders believed the Republicans' choice gave them an opportunity to win the White House for the first time since 1856 if the right candidate could be found.[76]

Among the Democrats, Samuel J. Tilden was the initial front-runner, having been the party's nominee in the contested election of 1876.[78] After Tilden declined a nomination due to his poor health, his supporters shifted to several other contenders.[78] Cleveland was among the leaders in early support, and Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware, Allen G. Thurman of Ohio, Samuel Freeman Miller of Iowa, and Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts also had considerable followings, along with various favorite sons.[78] Each of the other candidates had hindrances to his nomination: Bayard had spoken in favor of secession in 1861, making him unacceptable to Northerners; Butler, conversely, was reviled throughout the South for his actions during the Civil War; Thurman was generally well-liked, but was growing old and infirm, and his views on the silver question were uncertain.[79]

Cleveland, too, had detractors—Tammany remained opposed to him—but the nature of his enemies made him still more friends.[80] Cleveland led on the first ballot, with 392 votes out of 820.[81] On the second ballot, Tammany threw its support behind Butler, but the rest of the delegates shifted to Cleveland, who won.[82] Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana was selected as his running mate.[82]

Campaign against Blaine
Corruption in politics was the central issue in 1884; Blaine had over the span of his career been involved in several questionable deals.[83] Cleveland's reputation as an opponent of corruption proved the Democrats' strongest asset.[84] William C. Hudson created Cleveland's contextual campaign slogan &quot;A public office is a public trust.&quot;[85] Reform-minded Republicans called &quot;Mugwumps&quot; denounced Blaine as corrupt and flocked to Cleveland.[86] The Mugwumps, including such men as Carl Schurz and Henry Ward Beecher, were more concerned with morality than with party, and felt Cleveland was a kindred soul who would promote civil service reform and fight for efficiency in government.[86] At the same time that the Democrats gained support from the Mugwumps, they lost some blue-collar workers to the Greenback-Labor party, led by ex-Democrat Benjamin Butler.[87] In general, Cleveland abided by the precedent of minimizing presidential campaign travel and speechmaking; Blaine became one of the first to break with that tradition.[88]

The campaign focused on the candidates' moral standards, as each side cast aspersions on their opponents. Cleveland's supporters rehashed the old allegations that Blaine had corruptly influenced legislation in favor of the Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad and the Union Pacific Railway, later profiting on the sale of bonds he owned in both companies.[89] Although the stories of Blaine's favors to the railroads had made the rounds eight years earlier, this time Blaine's correspondence was discovered, making his earlier denials less plausible.[89] On some of the most damaging correspondence, Blaine had written &quot;Burn this letter&quot;, giving Democrats the last line to their rallying cry: &quot;Blaine, Blaine, James G. Blaine, the continental liar from the state of Maine, 'Burn this letter!'&quot;[90]

Regarding Cleveland, commentator Jeff Jacoby notes that, &quot;Not since George Washington had a candidate for President been so renowned for his rectitude.&quot;[91] But the Republicans found a refutation buried in Cleveland's past. Aided by the sermons of Reverend George H. Ball, a minister from Buffalo, they made public the allegation that Cleveland had fathered an illegitimate child while he was a lawyer there,[92] and their rallies soon included the chant &quot;Ma, Ma, where's my Pa?&quot;.[93] When confronted with the scandal, Cleveland immediately instructed his supporters to &quot;Above all, tell the truth.&quot;[50] Cleveland admitted to paying child support in 1874 to Maria Crofts Halpin, the woman who asserted he had fathered her son Oscar Folsom Cleveland and he assumed responsibility.[50] Shortly before the 1884 election, the Republican media published an affidavit from Halpin in which she stated that until she met Cleveland, her &quot;life was pure and spotless&quot;, and &quot;there is not, and never was, a doubt as to the paternity of our child, and the attempt of Grover Cleveland, or his friends, to couple the name of Oscar Folsom, or any one else, with that boy, for that purpose is simply infamous and false.&quot;[94]


Results of the 1884 election
The electoral votes of closely contested New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut would determine the election.[95] In New York, the Tammany Democrats decided that they would gain more from supporting a Democrat they disliked than a Republican who would do nothing for them.[96] Blaine hoped that he would have more support from Irish Americans than Republicans typically did; while the Irish were mainly a Democratic constituency in the 19th century, Blaine's mother was Irish Catholic, and he had been supportive of the Irish National Land League while he was Secretary of State.[97] The Irish, a significant group in three of the swing states, did appear inclined to support Blaine until a Republican, Samuel D. Burchard, gave a speech pivotal for the Democrats, denouncing them as the party of &quot;Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion&quot;.[98] The Democrats spread the word of this implied Catholic insult on the eve of the election. They also blistered Blaine for attending a banquet with some of New York City's wealthiest men.[99]

After the votes were counted, Cleveland narrowly won all four of the swing states, including New York by 1200 votes.[100] While the popular vote total was close, with Cleveland winning by just one-quarter of a percent, the electoral votes gave Cleveland a majority of 219–182.[100] Following the electoral victory, the &quot;Ma, Ma ...&quot; attack phrase gained a classic riposte: &quot;Gone to the White House. Ha! Ha! Ha!&quot;[101]

Reform

Cleveland portrayed as a tariff reformer
Soon after taking office, Cleveland was faced with the task of filling all the government jobs for which the president had the power of appointment. These jobs were typically filled under the spoils system, but Cleveland announced that he would not fire any Republican who was doing his job well, and would not appoint anyone solely on the basis of party service.[102] He also used his appointment powers to reduce the number of federal employees, as many departments had become bloated with political time-servers.[103] Later in his term, as his fellow Democrats chafed at being excluded from the spoils, Cleveland began to replace more of the partisan Republican officeholders with Democrats;[104] this was especially the case with policymaking positions.[105] While some of his decisions were influenced by party concerns, more of Cleveland's appointments were decided by merit alone than was the case in his predecessors' administrations.[106]

Cleveland also reformed other parts of the government. In 1887, he signed an act creating the Interstate Commerce Commission.[107] He and Secretary of the Navy William C. Whitney undertook to modernize the navy and canceled construction contracts that had resulted in inferior ships.[108] Cleveland angered railroad investors by ordering an investigation of western lands they held by government grant.[109] Secretary of the Interior Lucius Q. C. Lamar charged that the rights of way for this land must be returned to the public because the railroads failed to extend their lines according to agreements.[109] The lands were forfeited, resulting in the return of approximately 81,000,000 acres (330,000 km2).[109]

Cleveland was the first Democratic president subject to the Tenure of Office Act which originated in 1867; the act purported to require the Senate to approve the dismissal of any presidential appointee who was originally subject to its advice and consent. Cleveland objected to the act in principle and his steadfast refusal to abide by it prompted its fall into disfavor and led to its ultimate repeal in 1887.[110]

== Background ==

The building was one of a trio, called the &quot;360 Degrees Towers&quot;, commissioned by and being built for Fourscore Homes (named in some sources as &quot;Fourscore Heights&quot;), a United Kingdom-based private development company headed by Nigerian [[Femi Osibona]] (aka Olufemi Adegoke Osibona).&lt;ref name=&quot;Chile&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chile |first1=Nneka |title=Several workers trapped under collapsed highrise in Nigeria -witnesses |url=https://news.trust.org/item/20211101172658-39h1d/ |access-date=1 November 2021 |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fourscore Homes begins Shalom Place estate in Lagos |url=https://guardian.ng/property/fourscore-homes-begins-shalom-place-estate-in-lagos/ |access-date=1 November 2021 |work=The Guardian Nigeria |date=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Femi Osibona: Face behind collapsed 21-storey building in Ikoyi - P.M.

A consultancy, Prowess Engineering Limited, withdrew from the project in February, 2020, over concerns around the integrity of the building.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ajiboye&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ajiboye |first1=Gbemisola |title=We warned owners of Ikoyi collapsed building – Structural engineers |url=https://witnessngr.com/we-warned-owners-of-ikoyi-collapsed-building-structural-engineers/ |access-date=1 November 2021 |work=The Witness Newspaper |date=1 November 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lagos State Building Control Agency]] said within hours of the collapse that although 21 floors had been built, only 15 had been approved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ajiboye-2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ajiboye |first1=Gbemisola |title=Ikoyi collapsed building: We approved 15 floors, but owner built 21 floors – Agency |url=https://witnessngr.com/ikoyi-collapsed-building-we-approved-15-floors-but-owner-built-21-floors-agency/ |access-date=1 November 2021 |work=The Witness Newspaper |date=1 November 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enrico Maaßen''' (born 10 March 1984) is a German professional [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and former [[Football player|player]] who is the manager of [[Borussia Dortmund II]].

==Playing career==
A [[FC Anker Wismar]] youth graduate, Maaßen only played amateur football during his entire career. He subsequently represented [[FC Hansa Rostock II]], [[Greifswalder SV 04]], [[SC Verl]], [[Goslarer SC 08]] and [[SV Drochtersen/Assel]], retiring with the latter in 2014 at the age of 30, after suffering a serious [[knee]] injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.spox.com/de/sport/fussball/regionalliga/2006/Artikel/enrico-maassen-das-ist-der-neue-trainer-beim-bvb-ii-borussia-dortmund-skibbe-ftr.html|title=Borussia Dortmund – Enrico Maaßen: Das ist der neue Trainer beim BVB II|trans-title=Borussia Dortmund – Enrico Maaßen: This is the new coach at ''BVB'' II|publisher=Spox|language=de|date=15 June 2020|accessdate=1 November 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Managerial career==
Immediately after retiring, Maaßen was named manager of his last club SV Drochtersen/Assel. On 7 March 2018, after nearly four years in charge, his club confirmed that he would leave the post at the end of the season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sv-drochtersen-assel.com/2018/03/07/enrico-maassen-hoert-bei-d-a-als-trainer-auf/|title=Enrico Maaßen Hört Bei D/A Als Trainer Auf|trans-title=Enrico Maaßen is leaving ''D/A''{{'}}s manager role|publisher=SV Drochtersen/Assel|language=de|date=7 March 2018|accessdate=1 November 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was confirmed as manager of [[SV Rödinghausen]] for the 2018–19 campaign seven days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sv-drochtersen-assel.com/2018/03/14/enrico-maassen-wird-trainer-beim-sv-roedinghausen/|title=Enrico Maaßen Wird Trainer Beim SV Rödinghausen|trans-title=Enrico Maaßen becomes a manager at SV Rödinghausen|publisher=SV Drochtersen/Assel|language=de|date=14 March 2018|accessdate=1 November 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 June 2020, Maaßen was appointed manager of [[Borussia Dortmund]]'s [[Borussia Dortmund II|reserve team]], replacing [[Mike Tullberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bvb.de/News/Uebersicht/Enrico-Maassen-wird-neuer-Cheftrainer-der-U23|title=Enrico Maaßen wird neuer Cheftrainer der U23|trans-title=Enrico Maaßen is the new head coach of the U23|publisher=Borussia Dortmund|language=de|date=12 June 2020|accessdate=1 November 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; He renewed his contract until 2024 on 21 May of the following year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bvb.de/eng/News/Overview/Enrico-Maassen-signs-contract-extension|title=Enrico Maaßen signs contract extension|publisher=Borussia Dortmund|date=21 May 2021|accessdate=1 November 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; and achieved promotion to the [[3.

Deliverect is a Ghent-based startup founded by Zhong Xu, Jan Hollez, Jelte Vrijhoef, and Jerome Laredo in September 2018. Deliverect provides restaurants, dark kitchens and FMCG companies with an integrated solution to streamline and easily manage orders from online and third-party sources.

History

The inspiration for the company dates back to a time when Zhong Xu’s father, who was an Asian transplant to Belgium, had built a point of sale(PoS) system that he sold to the Chinese restaurants, hoping that his son would take over that business. Zhong saw that the problem was bigger than just the range of businesses his father was targeting. That first led Zhong and Jan to found POSiOS in 2011, the first iPad-based point of sale solution in Europe. 4 years later it was acquired by Lightspeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=POSIOS - Crunchbase Company Profile &amp; Funding|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/posios|access-date=2021-11-01|website=Crunchbase|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Deliverect was founded with a solution which integrates multiple hospitality systems such as online ordering, in-house dining, inventory management and more into a single SaaS platform that manages all of these different channels in one place.

Overview

Deliverect has processed more than 70 million orders. The platform eliminates the need to monitor multiple devices and manually re-enter orders into their existing system reducing both restaurant staff workload and number of errors.

The features are augmented by multi-sourced data to help the restaurants in making business decisions to help improve order accuracy and save time and labor, with the goal of increasing revenue.

Awards and Accolades

In 2018, Deliverect won innovation awards at Belgium’s Horeca Expo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Deliverect, the ‘Adyen of food delivery services’ raises €3M of fresh funding and wants to transform the restaurant industry {{!}} Silicon Canals|url=https://siliconcanals.com/news/startups/deliverect-the-adyen-of-food-delivery-services-raises-e3m-of-fresh-funding-and-wants-to-transform-the-restaurant-industry/|access-date=2021-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2019, they won Dutch hospitality fair Horecava awards. Both prizes were given to Deliverect’s solution for addressing a critical problem in the hospitality industry raised due to the rapid growth of the online delivery market. The same year they also received the Tech Product of the Year Award.

Partnerships and Integrations

Deliverect integrates online orders from different food delivery channels, such as Uber Eats, Doordash, Zomato and more. It also works with many cloud kitchens and restaurant chains supporting over 10,000 establishments, in over 30 markets around the world, including brands such as Pret a Manger, Taco Bell, TimeOut Markets, Taqueria, Le Pain Quotidien and Dishoom.

Funding

In 2019, Deliverect received Series A funding of €3M led by Newion and Smartfin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Deliverect raises €3m in funding for smart POS technology|url=https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/news/deliverect-funding/|access-date=2021-11-01|website=www.verdictfoodservice.com|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2020, Deliverect received Series B funding of €16.3M led by OMERS Ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Cherubini2020-04-29T08:00:00+01:00|first=Elena|title=Belgian food tech startup Deliverect raises €16.3m to expand internationally|url=https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/fundraising/belgian-food-tech-startup-deliverect-raises-163m-to-expand-internationally/604391.article|access-date=2021-11-01|website=The Grocer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=12 Benelux startups with the fastest-growing teams {{!}} Sifted|url=https://sifted.eu/articles/12-benelux-startups-with-the-fastest-growing-teams/|access-date=2021-11-01|website=sifted.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2021, Deliverect received Series C funding of $65M led by DST Global Partners, Redpoint ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Deliverect gobbles up $65M for a platform that streamlines online and offline food orders|url=https://social.techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/deliverect-gobbles-up-65m-for-a-platform-that-streamlines-online-and-offline-food-orders/|access-date=2021-11-01|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yoon Sang-won''' ({{korean|hangul=윤상원||hanja=尹祥源}}; 19 August 1950{{spaced ndash}}27 May 1980) was a [[South Korea]]n activist and spokesperson for the citizen's militia during the [[Gwangju Uprising|1980 Gwangju Democratization Movement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee interview&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jung |first1=Dae-ha |title=[Interview] Honoring the life of Yoon Sang-won, activist who died for democracy |url=https://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/945421.html |access-date=1 November 2021 |agency=hani.co.kr |publisher=The Hankyoreh |date=18 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Yoon was killed on the last day of the uprising and has since become a symbol in South Korea as a martyr for the [[democratization]] movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Katsiaficas&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Katsiaficas |first1=George |title=[Column] Remembering Yoon Sang-won |url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/english_editorials/796809.html |access-date=1 November 2021 |agency=hani.co.kr |publisher=The Hankyoreh |date=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Gwangju Jeollanam-do office building1.jpg|thumb|The former [[South Jeolla]] Provincial Office where Joon and others were killed on May 27, 1980.]]
Yoon Sang-won was born in [[Gwangsan District]], [[Gwangju]], and attended [[Chonnam National University]] in the 1970s.  Opposed to the military dictarship under [[Park Chung-hee]], Yoon quit his job at a bank in 1978 to focus on activism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee interview&quot; /&gt;  Yoon worked on organizing labour groups and helped form the National Democratic Workers’ League on May 1, 1980.  On May 18 of that year, a [[Gwangju Uprising|citizen's uprising]] against military rule broke out in Gwangju and Yoon quickly became the leading spokesperson of the organizing Democratic Struggle Committee.  As martial law forces violently suppressed the uprising, the armed resistance intensified.  Yoon and the remaining militia members took up residence in the main building of the {{ill|Jeonnam Provincial Office|ko|광주_전라남도청_구_본관}} which was turned into the ''de facto'' headquarters of the resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee interview&quot; /&gt;  The protesters were able to fortify and hold the building until May 27 when it was stormed by martial law forces.  Yoon was killed in the early morning making a last stand to defend the building.&lt;ref name=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kim |first1=Jin-hyun |title=Yoon Sang-won and Gwangju May 18 Uprising |url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2016/04/162_179069.html |access-date=1 November 2021 |agency=koreatimes.co.kr |publisher=The Korea Times |date=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Gwangju Democratization Movement ended that day, but it was seen as a precursor to the 1987 [[June Struggle]] that led to the country's first free and democratic [[1987 South Korean presidential election|elections later that year]] within the wider democratization movement known as [[minjung]].

== About Black Lunch Table ==
[http://www.theblacklunchtable.com Black Lunch Table (BLT)]is a nonprofit organization and sixteen-year ongoing artist collaboration.BLT’s primary aim has been the production of discursive sites, wherein cultural producers engage in dialogue on a variety of critical issues.

Black Lunch Table Wikimedians mobilize the creation and improvement of a specific set of Wikipedia articles that pertain to the lives and works of Black artists. In the field of mainstream contemporary art, Black artists are still marginalized within our field.

Wikipedia estimates that 77% of their editors are white and 91% of their editors are men. Our work shifts this demographic and empowers people to write their own history. Our sessions and events, including  BLT Photobooth and edit-a-thons, equip new editors with the skills and resources to create, update, and improve Wikipedia articles and encourages existing editors to focus on Wikipedia knowledge gaps.
{{meetup}}
== Articles and Artists to edit ==
Black Lunch Table's task list is made up of Black visual artists who are under-represented on Wikipedia. We welcome additions to our list so long as they are within our scope. We encourage editors to suggest artists ''who do not have a page'' or ''whose page is a stub'' over adding an artist who already has a substantial page and presence. Please always defer to Wikipedia's NOTABILTY guidelines for new pages.

[[Wikipedia:Meetup/Black_Lunch_Table/Lists_of_Articles|'''''BLT's Main Task List''''']]

==Artists associated with LOCATION==
Please suggest specific artists who are notable BlackXXXXX who need their article created or whose existing article needs improvement.
Be sure they qualify according to Wikipedia's NOTABILITY guidelines, thanks!

The '''upcoming studio album''' by Spanish singer [[Rosalía (singer)|Rosalía]], her third, is scheduled to be released through [[Columbia Records]].

== Background and recording ==
In November 2018, Rosalía released her second studio album ''[[El mal querer|El Mal Querer]]'' to critical acclaim and commercial succes. The album, inspired by the ''[[Romance of Flamenca]]'', a 13th-centrury annonymous Occitan novel, launched the singer's career to another level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=País|first=Ediciones El|date=2019-09-04|title=La novela medieval que inspiró 'El mal querer' de Rosalía renace en las librerías|url=https://verne.elpais.com/verne/2019/09/04/articulo/1567594882_786552.html|access-date=2020-07-02|website=Verne|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; By twisting [[flamenco music]] and giving it a more modern interpretations, Rosalía became very popular among critics and general public mainly in selected parts of Europe and Latin America. ''El Mal Querer'' was listed in many year-end publications as well as in ''[[Rolling Stone]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=#315 Rosalía, 'El Mal Querer' (2018)|url=https://www.rs500albums.com/350-301/315|access-date=2021-11-01|website=Rolling Stone 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recording sessions for the singer's next project began in [[Los Angeles]] as early as 2019 and, in October of that year, Rosalía confirmed to ''[[W Magazine|W]]'' that her new album would be released in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Rosalía Is the Future of Pop Music|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/rosalia-music-cover-story-interview/|access-date=2020-07-03|website=W Magazine {{!}} Women's Fashion &amp; Celebrity News|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=LOS40|date=2019-10-01|title=Rosalía desvela cuando saldrá su próximo disco|url=https://los40.com/los40/2019/10/01/musica/1569917125_264720.html|access-date=2020-07-03|website=LOS40|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, while on tour in 2019, Rosalía released a collection of singles instead. In March, the first of eight singles, &quot;[[Con Altura]]&quot;, featuring [[J Balvin]] and [[El Guincho]] was released on digital platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2019-04-01|title=¿Qué críticas ha generado la nueva canción de Rosalía?|url=https://us.hola.com/actualidad/20190401139835/rosalia-balvin-opiniones-nuevo-single/|access-date=2019-10-18|website=HOLA USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track, which includes the signature lyric 'La Rosalía', topped the charts in Argentina, Venezuela, Spain and Colombia among others and was the second most-watched music video released in 2019 on [[YouTube]] and the most-watched female music video as well as the first on the list by a Spanish language song.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2019-07-08|title=Rosalía’s ‘Con Altura’ the highest viewed video by a female artist this year|url=https://tonedeaf.thebrag.com/rosalias-con-altura-the-highest-viewed-video-by-a-female-artist-this-year/|access-date=2020-07-02|website=Tone Deaf|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song won the [[Latin Grammy Award|Latin Grammy award]] for [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Urban Song|Best Urban Song]] and two [[MTV Video Music Award|MTV Video Music Awards]]. May saw the release of &quot;[[Aute Cuture]]&quot; whereas &quot;[[Milionària]]&quot; and &quot;[[Dios nos libre del dinero|Dios Nos Libre del Dinero]]&quot; were released in July. In August, a collaboration with [[Ozuna (singer)|Ozuna]], &quot;[[Yo x Ti, Tu x Mi]]&quot;, was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2019-08-26|title=Rosalia &amp; Ozuna's Performance At The 2019 MTV VMAs: Watch|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/awards/8528405/rosalia-ozuna-performance-2019-mtv-vmas-video|access-date=2020-07-02|website=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; The singer continued releasing independent tracks such as &quot;[[A Palé]]&quot;, &quot;[[Dolerme]]&quot; and &quot;[[Juro Que]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Aswad|first=Jem|last2=Aswad|first2=Jem|date=2019-11-07|title=Rosalia Drops Hard-Hitting New Song and Video, ‘A Pale’|url=https://variety.com/2019/music/news/rosalia-drops-hard-hitting-new-song-and-video-a-pale-1203397643/|access-date=2020-07-02|website=Variety|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosalía also collaborated twice with [[Travis Scott]]; firstly on the remix of his track &quot;[[Highest in the Room]]&quot; alongside [[Lil Baby]] and then on &quot;[[TKN (song)|TKN]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Wang|first=Steffanee|title=Rosalía Ad-Libs On Travis Scott's &quot;Highest In The Room&quot; Remix|url=https://www.nylon.com/rosalia-travis-scott-highest-in-the-room-remix|access-date=2020-07-02|website=Nylon|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-06-10|title=Rosalia Makes Hot 100 Debut, Bows at No. 2 on Hot Latin Songs With &amp;#39;TKN&amp;#39;|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/9399656/rosalia-travis-scott-tkn-hot-100-hot-latin-songs|access-date=2020-07-03|website=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Dutch radio station [[3VOOR12]] asked the singer through a ''[[Zoom Video Communications|Zoom]]'' press conference about a possible single [[Compilation album|compilation]] or [[box set]], Rosalía expressed total rejection to the idea explaining that &quot;I don't really enjoy singles that are collections of singles. I usually enjoy records that tell a story and that are alive and a lot of thinking. I am totally against the first idea&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Rosalía denkt niet in singles maar in projecten|url=https://3voor12.vpro.nl/update~a5ab69d2-1c4f-4ec2-82cb-98ab87022e3a~rosal%C3%ADa-denkt-niet-in-singles-maar-in-projecten~.html|access-date=2020-07-02|website=3voor12|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also stated that she was &quot;trying really hard to release a new project this year but all of the singles you've heard so far won't be included. As a musician I feel the responsibility to release a cohesive album, one that makes sense; one in where the songs are linked and share an essence. In conclusion, I want to make an album that makes sense as you listen to it as a whole&quot;. She also told [[La Repubblica|''La Repubblica'']] and [[El Universal (Mexico City)|''El Universal'']] that this new project will not have any collaboration despite teasing a duet with [[Arca (musician)|Arca]] shortly after and being spotted with musicians like [[Playboi Carti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Rosalía pide visibilizar a las mujeres|url=https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/espectaculos/rosalia-pide-visibilizar-las-mujeres|access-date=2020-07-03|website=www.eluniversal.com.mx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosalía was also seen in the recording studio with [[Michael Uzowuru]] and [[Mike Dean (record producer)|Mike Dean]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=LOS40|date=2021-04-14|title=Rosalía pierde la noción del tiempo trabajando en su nueva música: “No sé si es domingo o martes”|url=https://los40.com/los40/2021/04/14/musica/1618412288_505210.html|access-date=2021-11-01|website=LOS40|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2020, [[Pharrell Williams]] stated that he was &quot;blown away by its title&quot; and was &quot;honoured to be a part of it”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Pharrell discusses Rosalía’s new album, says he’s “honoured to be a part of it”|url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/news/latest-news/pharrell-discusses-rosalias-new-album-says-hes-honoured-to-be-a-part-of-it|access-date=2021-11-01|website=The Line of Best Fit|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2021, Rosalía kept teasing her upcoming studio album yet released more independent singles such as &quot;[[Lo Vas a Olvidar]]&quot; alongside [[Billie Eilish]] for ''[[Euphoria (American TV series)|Euphoria]]'', and &quot;[[Linda (Tokischa and Rosalía song)|Linda]]&quot; with [[Tokischa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Billie Eilish and Rosalía’s Highly Anticipated Collab 'Lo Vas a Olvidar' Is Dropping This Week|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9513330/billie-eilish-rosalia-lo-vas-a-olvidar-euphoria-new-song-teaser|access-date=2021-11-01|website=Billboard|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=First Stream Latin: Randy's Album, Anitta &amp; Saweetie's Collab, Plus More New Music|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/9646084/first-stream-latin-randy-anitta-saweetie|access-date=2021-11-01|website=Billboard|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May, talent manager Rebecca León confirmed that Rosalía wouldn't release an album in 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Rodríguez|first=Por Christian|date=2021-05-06|title=Lo sentimos: Rosalía no lanzará este año su nuevo disco|url=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/es/famosos/musica/a36352751/rosalia-nuevo-disco-2021/|access-date=2021-11-01|website=Cosmopolitan|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, Rosalía revealed to [[Santiago Matías]] that the album &quot;was already taking shape but I don't know how many songs it'll have&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Moda|first=S.|date=2021-08-12|title=Rosalía en una radio dominicana: &quot;Me desenamoro muy fácilmente&quot; {{!}} Celebrities, Vips|url=https://smoda.elpais.com/celebrities/vips/rosalia-entrevista-feminismo-j-balvin-amor-alofoke/|access-date=2021-11-01|website=S Moda EL PAÍS|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, the singer teased on [[TikTok]] that the project will be released &quot;soon&quot; and premiered 30 seconds of an unreleased track believed to be the lead single.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2021-10-12|title=It Seems Rosalía is Dropping A Bachata Track — &amp; People Have Thoughts|url=https://remezcla.com/music/rosalia-bachata-response-tiktok/|access-date=2021-11-01|website=Remezcla|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a fan meet and greet in Mexico in partnership with [[Exa FM]], Rosalía revealed that her new album will be &quot;very different and will be enjoyed&quot; by her fans. She also revealed that the lead single would be released in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2021-10-20|title=¡Paren todo porque Rosalía anda de paseo en CDMX y echó taco en Orinoco!|url=https://www.sopitas.com/musica/rosalia-en-cdmx-tacos-orinoco-el-parnita-colonia-roma-videos-fotos/|access-date=2021-11-01|website=Sopitas.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tour ===
In October 2021, in the mark of the BIME Pro music conference, tour manager Agustín Boffi revealed that Rosalía will embark on a &quot;would tour in 2022&quot; that has been being prepared &quot;for over a year&quot;. Boffi also revealed that the tour crew will be expanded to &quot;over 150 people&quot; compared to the 40 people that were working on [[El Mal Querer Tour|her previous concert cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Deia|title=Agustín Boffi: &quot;Lleva más de un año preparar una gira internacional como la de Rosalía&quot;|url=https://www.deia.eus/cultura/2021/10/27/agustin-boffi-lleva-ano-preparar/1162458.html|access-date=2021-11-01|website=www.deia.eus|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francisco Jareño y Alarcón'''  (24 February 1818 – 8 October 1892 ) was a Spanish architect, author of one of the most remarkable official buildings of the [[Reign of Isabella II of Spain]].{{sfn|Preckler|2003|p=191}}

==Life==

Jareño was born in [[Albacete]] on 24 February 1818.
He entered the diocesan seminary as a young man to pursue ecclesiastical studies, remaining there for nine years.
In 1833 he left it to enter the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid, where he graduated in 1848, at the age of thirty, after completing a brilliant academic career.
Thanks to a scholarship, Jareño had the opportunity to go abroad and travel, over a period of four years, to various countries in Europe.
He had the opportunity to learn about how iron was used as an architectural element in several European cities.
Upon his return, and with new financial aid from the State, he would travel to England and Germany again.
He returned to Madrid in 1855, where he was appointed Professor of Art History at the then Special School of Architecture.{{sfn|Dos apuntes biográficos}}

Of his first years of practice, the project of the Central School of Agriculture of Aranjuez of 1856 stands out, the first work that is known of Jareño, as well as the intervention, in collaboration with Nicómedes Mendívil, in the disappeared Spanish Mint, built in the space that today occupies the Plaza de Colón (Madrid).
Between 1874 and 1875 he was director of the School of Architects, as well as a permanent academic of the Royal Academy of San Fernando (1867), Knight of the Royal and Distinguished Order of Carlos III (1858), Grand Cross of the Civil Order of María Victoria (1872), among others.{{sfn|Dos apuntes biográficos}}

He was a member of the party's national council in the early 1980s and again from 2001, joining its executive in 2003.&lt;ref name=van&gt;{{cite news |title=Francisco Jorquera: la esencia del BNG|trans-title=Francisco Jorquera: the essence of the BNG|url=https://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20121001/54352147794/francisco-jorquera-bng.html |access-date=1 November 2021 |work=[[La Vanguardia]] |date=1 October 2012 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohen Milstein has been hired by various state attorneys general to assist in complex litigation, including by suing [[ExxonMobil]] over climate change. [[Anita Hill]] is of counsel at the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thompson |first1=Krissah |title=For Anita Hill, the Clarence Thomas hearings haven’t really ended |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-anita-hill-the-clarence-thomas-hearings-havent-really-ended/2011/10/05/gIQAy2b5QL_story.html |access-date=1 November 2021 |work=Washington Post |date=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits against Donald Trump==

The firm assisted District of Columbia Attorney General [[Karl Racine]] and [[Attorney General of Maryland]] [[Brian Frosh]] in filing a lawsuit accusing President [[Donald Trump]] of using his hotel in Washington D.C. to unconstitutionally profit from his political office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Woellert |first1=Lorraine |last2=Gerstein |first2=Josh |title=Judge green-lights subpoenas in Trump Hotel lawsuit |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/03/subpoenas-trump-hotel-emoluments-1041324 |work=POLITICO |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[D.C. and Maryland v. Trump]]'' alleged that Trump had violated the [[Foreign Emoluments Clause]]. In January 2021, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] issued a summary disposition ordering the Fourth Circuit to dismiss the case as moot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shah |first1=Maryam |title=DC AG Racine, AG Frosh on Conclusion of Emoluments Lawsuit |url=https://www.stl.news/dc-ag-racine-ag-frosh-on-conclusion-of-emoluments-lawsuit/433247/ |access-date=1 November 2021 |publisher=STL News |date=25 January 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2021, on behalf of Democratic U.S. Representative [[Bennie Thompson]], Cohen Milstein and the [[NAACP]] filed a lawsuit against former President Trump and [[Rudy Giuliani]] over their role in the [[2021 United States Capitol attack]].

Cohen Milstein has a practice area in which it helps state attorneys general with complex litigation.&lt;ref name=hill&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mali |first1=Meghashyam |title=Exxon allies cry foul over law firm in climate probe |url=https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/288924-exxon-allies-cry-foul-over-law-firm-in-climate-probe |access-date=1 November 2021 |work=TheHill |date=23 July 2016 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, ''The New York Times'' wrote that Cohen Milstein was part of &quot;a flourishing industry that pairs plaintiffs' lawyers with state attorneys general to sue companies, a collaboration that has set off a furious competition between trial lawyers and corporate lobbyists to influence these officials.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lipton |first1=Eric |title=Lawyers Create Big Paydays by Coaxing Attorneys General to Sue |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/19/us/politics/lawyers-create-big-paydays-by-coaxing-attorneys-general-to-sue-.html |access-date=26 October 2021 |work=The New York Times |date=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm has been a major donor to state attorneys general associations, candidates, state party committees, and attorneys general running for governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Political Gifts from Plaintiffs’ Lawyers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/19/us/politics/political-gifts-from-plaintiffs-lawyers.html |access-date=26 October 2021 |work=The New York Times |date=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Attorney General of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Claude Walker, authorized the firm to investigate whether [[ExxonMobil]] had committed fraud by denying climate change.&lt;ref name=hill/&gt; Cohen Milstein stood to earn as much as 27% percent of any monetary damages generated by the litigation, plus some costs. That arrangement was criticized by Exxon, who said it gave the law firm an inappropriate profit motive and that Walker had ceded too much authority to outside lawyers by authorizing them to act as prosecutors. Exxon sued Cohen Milstein, arguing the firm wasn't disinterested in the case because it stood to earn a contingency fee. Exxon's suit alleged constitutional violations regarding free speech, due process, and unreasonable searches and seizures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cassens Weiss |first1=Debra |title=Exxon sues law firm that sought climate change documents |url=https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/exxon_sues_law_firm_seeking_climate_change_documents |access-date=1 November 2021 |work=ABA Journal |date=April 18, 2016 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
